# Application Server / Backend Layer

## Concept / What

An **Application Server** (or backend server) runs the business logic in response to user requests, generates dynamic content, connects to databases, and exposes REST APIs for communication with frontend and third-party services. It acts as a bridge between the front-end and data layer, and can host multiple microservices built in different languages (Java, Node.js, Python).

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Handles **business logic** independently from frontend and database.
* Exposes **REST APIs** for frontend and third-party communication.
* Can scale and be maintained independently from other layers.
* Supports **microservices architecture**, allowing different languages and services per microservice.
* Connects to **databases** and **third-party APIs** like payment gateways, messaging services, or cloud APIs.

## How it Works / Steps / Syntax

### Request Flow

```
[Client/Frontend] --> REST API Request --> [Application Server / Microservice] --> DB / 3rd Party API
Response --> [Application Server] --> Client
```

### Key Functionalities

1. **Dynamic Content Generation**: Returns personalized data, dashboards, or computed results.
2. **Microservices Support**: Each service can be independent, run on different languages, and scale separately.
3. **Third-party Integrations**: API calls to payment gateways, messaging platforms, or external services.
4. **Security**:

   * **JWT**: Stateless authentication; any backend pod can validate tokens.
   * **OAuth**: Delegated access to third-party resources without sharing passwords.
   * **Sticky Sessions**: Optional session affinity for stateful apps.
   * **API Throttling / Rate Limiting**: Protects against abuse or application-layer DDoS.
   * **WAF / TLS / IAM roles**: Protect endpoints and enforce secure access.
5. **Scaling & Load Balancing**:

   * **ALB/NLB** to distribute traffic.
   * **Auto Scaling** of pods or EC2 instances.
   * Stateless design (JWT) allows any pod to serve requests.

## Common Issues / Errors

* 500 Internal Server Errors due to unhandled exceptions.
* High latency or slow response times from database or third-party APIs.
* Scaling failures when traffic spikes.
* Session inconsistencies if sticky sessions are misconfigured.
* Security misconfigurations: JWT secret leaks, OAuth scope errors, API abuse.

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Monitor logs and metrics to identify failing services.
* Use **circuit breakers** or **retries** for unstable third-party calls.
* Configure **auto-scaling policies** and health checks.
* Rotate JWT signing keys and OAuth client secrets securely.
* Implement proper **rate-limiting and WAF rules**.
* Use HTTPS and secure cookies for client-side tokens.

## Best Practices / Tips

* Prefer **stateless JWTs** over sticky sessions for scalable architectures.
* Store **JWT signing keys and OAuth client secrets** in secure stores like AWS Secrets Manager or Vault.
* Use **microservices** for modular, language-agnostic business logic.
* Secure APIs with **rate-limiting, WAF, and IAM roles**.
* Monitor backend services and configure **alerts** for errors, latency, and security events.
* Integrate CI/CD pipelines to deploy backend services safely without downtime.
* Use **ALB/NLB** combined with auto-scaling for resilient and highly available applications.
* Always enforce **HTTPS** and secure token handling on the client side.

## Example / AWS-K8s Implementation

* **Kubernetes**: Deploy backend microservices as pods behind an ALB Ingress.
* **Scaling**: HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) adjusts pod count based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.
* **Security**: JWT issued by auth service; pods validate using signing key stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
* **Third-party APIs**: Backend service calls payment gateway APIs via REST; retries and circuit breakers implemented.
* **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and Prometheus/Grafana for latency, error rates, and resource usage.

# REST API Design and Resource-Oriented URLs - DevOps Notes

## Concept / What

* **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows software components to communicate.
* **REST APIs** are HTTP-based, stateless, resource-oriented endpoints connecting frontend and backend.
* Backend may connect internally to databases or third-party APIs; frontend always communicates via REST APIs.

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Enables **frontend → backend** and **backend → third-party** communication.
* **Stateless** requests allow scaling backend pods or EC2 instances independently.
* Clean and predictable **resource-oriented URLs** like `/users/123` make APIs intuitive and cacheable.
* Supports microservices architecture with different languages (Java, Node.js, Python).

## How it Works / Steps / Flow

```
[Client / Frontend]
      │
      │ HTTP Request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
      ▼
[API Gateway / ALB]   --> optional WAF, throttling
      │
      ▼
[Backend / Application Server]
      │
      ├─ Authenticate request (JWT / OAuth)
      ├─ Validate payload
      ├─ Call business logic / microservice
      ├─ Query / update database or call 3rd-party API
      ▼
[Response] ── JSON / XML ──> Client
```

### Types of APIs

* **REST:** HTTP-based, stateless, JSON/XML, resource-oriented. Preferred for frontend-backend communication.
* **SOAP:** Protocol-based, XML, heavier, enterprise apps.
* **GraphQL:** Single endpoint, client specifies fields.
* **gRPC / Thrift:** Binary protocols, internal microservice communication.

### Resource-Oriented URLs

* URLs represent **resources**; HTTP method defines action.
* Examples:

  * `GET /users/123` → fetch user
  * `PUT /users/123` → update user
  * `DELETE /users/123` → delete user
* Nested resources: `/users/123/orders` → fetch orders for user 123
* Benefits: clean, cacheable, scalable, intuitive.

## Common Issues / Errors

* CORS errors when frontend and backend are on different domains.
* Incorrect HTTP method usage.
* Missing or invalid headers (Authorization, Content-Type).
* Inconsistent API versioning or endpoint structure.
* Misconfigured load balancers or API gateways affecting request routing.

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Use API documentation (Swagger / OpenAPI) for consistent contracts.
* Ensure **CORS headers** are set for cross-domain requests.
* Validate payloads and handle errors consistently.
* Monitor **latency, error rates, and throughput** via CloudWatch, Prometheus, or Grafana.
* Apply **rate limiting and WAF** rules to protect endpoints.

## Best Practices / Tips (DevOps Focus)

* Prefer **resource-oriented URLs** for cleaner, scalable APIs.
* Ensure APIs are **stateless** to allow any pod to handle requests.
* Use **JWT / OAuth** for authentication and authorization.
* Monitor APIs for **availability, latency, and errors** rather than internal resource handling.
* Keep **backend → database** communication internal; frontend should only use exposed APIs.

## AWS / K8s Example

* Backend pods in **EKS** behind an **ALB**.
* REST API endpoints exposed via **API Gateway**.
* JWT validated in backend pods; OAuth used for third-party API access.
* Backend connects internally to **RDS / DynamoDB**.
* CloudWatch monitors **API latency, error codes, and throttling events**.

---

# Dynamic Content Generation - DevOps Notes

## Concept / What

* **Dynamic content** is generated on-the-fly by the backend based on user requests.
* Backend processes **user input, session data, database queries, or third-party API responses** to create customized responses.
* Responses are usually sent as **JSON (or XML/HTML)** for frontend applications to render.

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Provides **personalized user experiences** (dashboards, shopping carts, search results).
* Enables **real-time updates** (notifications, live feeds).
* Supports **integration with databases and third-party APIs**.
* Essential for **interactive web applications** rather than static content.

**Examples:**

* E-commerce: personalized product listings.
* Social media: friend activity feed.
* Banking apps: user account balances and transactions.

---

## How it Works / Steps / Flow

```
[Client / Browser] 
      │
      │ HTTP Request (GET /user/123/profile)
      ▼
[Load Balancer / API Gateway]
      │
      ▼
[Backend / Application Server]
      │
      ├─ Authenticate request (JWT/OAuth)
      ├─ Fetch data from Database / 3rd-party API
      ├─ Apply business logic / application logic
      ├─ Render response dynamically (JSON / HTML / XML)
      ▼
[Response] ── Dynamic content ──> Frontend renders on UI
```

### Notes from Discussion / Doubts

* **JSON response**: Backend sends dynamic content as JSON; frontend parses and renders on UI.
* **Backend responsibilities**: Authentication, authorization, business logic, database / third-party API integration.
* **Frontend responsibilities**: Rendering JSON into interactive UI; DevOps focus is backend delivery and reliability.
* **Statelessness**: Each request contains all info; any backend pod can handle it.

### Techniques

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: HTML rendered on server before sending (Java Spring MVC, Node.js + EJS).
* **API-driven Dynamic Content**: Backend sends JSON; frontend renders dynamically (React, Angular, Vue).
* **Template Engines**: Embed logic in HTML templates (EJS, Thymeleaf, Handlebars).

---

## Common Issues / Errors

* High **latency** due to slow DB queries or heavy processing.
* Backend overload under high traffic.
* Incorrect user-specific data due to failed authentication or session handling.
* Rendering errors from broken templates or missing data.

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Optimize database queries, indexing, caching, and pagination.
* Use **load balancing and auto-scaling** for high traffic.
* Validate data before rendering to avoid template errors.
* Use **CDNs or edge caching** for partially cacheable dynamic content.
* Monitor performance via **CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana**.

---

## Best Practices / Tips

* Separate **business logic from presentation** for maintainability.
* Use **caching** for frequently accessed dynamic data.
* Prefer **API-driven content** for microservices architecture.
* Ensure **secure handling of user-specific data** (JWT/OAuth, sessions).
* Monitor backend performance to prevent slow content generation.

---

## Real-world Cloud Example (AWS / K8s)

* Backend pods in **EKS** or EC2 serve dynamic content.
* Requests distributed by **ALB**.
* Data fetched from **RDS / DynamoDB** or **third-party APIs**.
* Partial caching via **ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached)**.
* Frontend consumes JSON APIs and renders dynamic UI.
* **Monitoring** via CloudWatch for latency, errors, and throughput.

# Backend Connection with Frontend (API Endpoints) - Detailed Notes (DevOps)

## Concept / What

* API endpoints are URLs exposed by the backend for frontend or external clients to request data or perform actions.
* Backend exposes **REST APIs** (or WebSocket/GraphQL) to communicate with frontend.
* Frontend **consumes** these APIs, does not expose its own REST API externally.
* Requests are routed through **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to backend instances/pods.

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Provides a **standardized communication interface** between frontend and backend.
* Decouples frontend and backend development.
* Enables microservices architecture: each service can expose its own endpoints.
* Supports authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and monitoring.
* Common use cases: fetching product data, submitting forms, updating user profiles.

## How it Works / Steps / Flow

1. **Frontend request:** Browser or client sends HTTP request (e.g., `GET /api/products`).
2. **ALB:** Request goes to ALB which handles:

   * SSL termination
   * Routing rules (path-based, host-based)
   * Security (WAF, throttling)
   * Health checks
3. **Backend routing:** ALB forwards request to a backend EC2 instance or pod **on the configured port** (e.g., 8080).
4. **REST API endpoint:** Backend service receives request on the port, routes it to the appropriate endpoint.
5. **Processing:**

   * Authenticate/authorize (JWT/OAuth)
   * Apply business logic
   * Query database or call third-party API
6. **Response:** Backend generates JSON/XML response → returns through ALB → frontend parses and renders UI.

**Flow Diagram (ASCII):**

```
Frontend (Browser)
    │
    │ GET /api/products
    ▼
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    │  ┌─ SSL / WAF / Routing
    │  └─ Forward to backend target port (e.g., 8080)
    ▼
Backend Service (REST API)
    │  ├─ Auth / JWT check
    │  ├─ Business logic
    │  ├─ DB / 3rd-party call
    │  └─ Prepare JSON response
    ▼
ALB → Response → Frontend UI
```

## Common Issues / Errors

* Unauthorized access (401) due to invalid JWT/OAuth tokens
* Bad request (400) due to missing headers or payload
* High latency or 5xx errors if backend overloaded
* CORS errors if frontend and backend are on different domains
* Misconfigured ALB routing or unhealthy backend targets

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Validate tokens and headers for API requests
* Use API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) to confirm request structure
* Apply load balancing, auto-scaling, and circuit breakers
* Monitor latency, error rates, and throughput using CloudWatch/Prometheus
* Configure ALB properly for correct target groups and ports
* Enable WAF rules and rate limiting to protect APIs

## Best Practices / Tips (DevOps)

* Keep REST API endpoints **stateless** for easy scaling across pods/instances
* Secure endpoints using JWT/OAuth and TLS/HTTPS
* Version your APIs (`/v1/`, `/v2/`) to maintain backward compatibility
* Monitor API performance, errors, and traffic patterns
* Apply caching where applicable to reduce backend load
* Use ALB path-based routing and health checks to improve reliability

## Real-world Cloud Example

* **AWS Setup:**

  * Frontend (React/Angular) calls `https://mystore.com/api/products`
  * DNS resolves to **ALB**, which handles HTTPS and routes to backend targets
  * Backend pod/EC2 instance exposes **REST API** on port 8080
  * Backend queries RDS/DynamoDB or third-party APIs
  * JSON response returned through ALB → frontend renders products
* **DevOps focus:** Configure ALB, monitor backend pods, ensure security (WAF, JWT), auto-scale backend based on traffic.

# Load Balancing (ALB, NLB) and Session Handling - Detailed Notes

## Concept / What

* **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend instances/pods to avoid overload and ensure high availability.
* **Session Handling**: Maintains user session state (login, cart, preferences) across multiple requests in a distributed system.
* Supports modern cloud-native applications, APIs, and microservices.

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Prevents single point of failure → requests routed to healthy instances.
* Improves performance and scalability.
* Enables microservices and stateless designs.
* Ensures session persistence for user experience.
* Use cases: Web apps, REST APIs, e-commerce checkout flows, real-time apps.

## How it Works / Steps / Flow

### **Load Balancer Types (AWS ELB)**

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

   * Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
   * Path-based or host-based routing (`/login`, `/cart`)
   * Integrates with WAF, SSL termination, throttling
   * Best for APIs and web apps

2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**

   * Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
   * Ultra-low latency, millions of requests/sec
   * Routes based on IP and port
   * Best for high-throughput or latency-sensitive apps

### **Session Handling Approaches**

1. **Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)**

   * ALB inserts a cookie (e.g., `AWSALB`) to tie a user to a backend instance.
   * Simple, but not resilient to instance failure.

2. **Centralized Session Store**

   * Store sessions in **Redis / ElastiCache / Database**.
   * Any server/pod can fetch session data.
   * More reliable and scalable.

3. **JWT (Stateless Authentication)**

   * Application issues signed token to client.
   * Client stores token (cookie/localStorage).
   * Each request carries JWT → any pod can validate.
   * No server-side session storage required.

### **Request Flow Example (JWT + ALB)**

```
User → ALB (HTTPS) → Backend pod (Port 8080)
      → Auth logic validates credentials
      → Issues JWT signed with secret key (Secrets Manager/KMS)
      → JWT sent to client (cookie/localStorage)
      → Next requests carry JWT in Authorization header
      → ALB forwards to any pod → pod validates JWT → response sent back
```

### **Other Session Variations**

* DB-backed sessions (RDS, DynamoDB, MongoDB) → slower, less common.
* OAuth2/OpenID Connect → external authentication provider, works with JWT.
* SAML sessions → legacy enterprise systems.
* Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd) → advanced token/session propagation between microservices.

## Common Issues / Errors

* Users get logged out if sticky session target dies.
* Sticky sessions → risk of overloading one server.
* Redis session store → bottleneck if unscaled.
* JWT secret key leak → security vulnerability.
* Misconfigured ALB target groups → traffic not reaching backend.

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Enable ALB **target group health checks**.
* Scale Redis/ElastiCache as needed.
* Rotate JWT signing keys via **KMS/Secrets Manager**.
* Monitor CloudWatch metrics: latency, 4xx/5xx errors, unhealthy hosts.
* Configure WAF rules and rate limiting for protection.

## Best Practices / Tips

✅ Prefer **JWT/stateless sessions** for scalable microservices.
✅ If using sessions, store centrally in Redis or DB.
✅ Enable WAF + throttling to protect ALB.
✅ Keep endpoints stateless; any pod can serve requests.
✅ Encrypt JWT secrets and session credentials in **Secrets Manager / KMS**.
✅ Monitor performance and health metrics actively.

## Real-world Cloud Example

* **E-commerce app**:

  * ALB handles HTTPS, path-based routing (`/cart`, `/checkout`).
  * JWT used for authentication → any backend pod can validate session.
  * Redis for cart session storage.
  * NLB used for payment gateway (low-latency TCP traffic).

**DevOps Role:**

* Configure ALB stickiness if needed.
* Deploy/manage Redis or session DB.
* Store/manage JWT secret keys securely.
* Monitor load balancer, session store, and backend pod health.
* Ensure scaling policies are effective for high traffic.

# Auto Scaling of Backend Pods / EC2 Instances - Detailed Notes

## Concept / What

* **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of running instances (EC2) or pods (Kubernetes) based on demand, load, or schedule.
* Ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency.

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Handles traffic spikes automatically.
* Reduces cost during low traffic by scaling down.
* Maintains application performance and reliability.
* Use Cases: E-commerce sites during sales, microservices with variable load, batch-processing workloads.

## How it Works / Steps / Flow

### AWS EC2 Auto Scaling

1. **Launch Template / Launch Configuration**: Defines instance type, AMI, security, user data.
2. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Attach to VPC/subnets, define min/max/desired instances.
3. **Scaling Policies / Triggers**:

   * Target tracking (e.g., CPU 50%)
   * Step scaling (e.g., add 2 instances if CPU > 70%)
   * Scheduled scaling (e.g., scale at 9 AM daily)
4. Traffic from ALB → ASG launches additional EC2s as needed.

### Kubernetes Auto Scaling

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** → scales pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
2. **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** → adjusts pod resource requests/limits.
3. **Cluster Autoscaler** → scales worker nodes (EC2) based on pending pods.

**HPA Example Manifest**:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: backend-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: backend
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

### Launch Template vs Launch Configuration

* **Launch Configuration**: Legacy, no versioning, limited features.
* **Launch Template**: Modern, supports versioning, overrides, latest EC2 features, recommended for new setups.

## Common Issues

* Over-scaling → cost increases.
* Under-scaling → latency, 5xx errors.
* Cooldown periods misconfigured → new instances launched too soon.
* Cold start latency for pods/EC2s.

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Monitor CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, request count).
* Tune scaling thresholds.
* Use readiness probes in K8s to prevent traffic to unready pods.
* Combine HPA + Cluster Autoscaler for Kubernetes.
* Test scaling policies in staging.

## Best Practices / Tips

✅ Use target-tracking policies for predictable scaling.
✅ Set min/max limits to control cost and resources.
✅ Combine HPA + VPA + Cluster Autoscaler in Kubernetes.
✅ Ensure ALB health checks are accurate.
✅ Monitor metrics and set alerts.
✅ Use scheduled scaling for predictable traffic spikes.

## Real-world Example

* E-commerce backend:

  * HPA scales pods when CPU > 50%.
  * Cluster Autoscaler adds EC2 nodes if pods cannot schedule.
  * ALB distributes traffic across pods → zero downtime.
  * VPA adjusts pod resource requests automatically.

## DevOps Role

* Create/manage Launch Templates for ASG.
* Define scaling policies and triggers.
* Deploy HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler for Kubernetes.
* Monitor metrics and optimize cost/performance.
* Test scaling in staging before production.

# Security: WAF, IAM Roles, API Throttling - Detailed Notes

## Concept / What

* Security for backend/application servers ensures protection from unauthorized access, attacks, and misuse.
* Focus areas: Access control, request filtering, traffic management, and resource protection.

## Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Protect sensitive data and APIs from attacks like DDoS, SQL injection, XSS, and malicious bots.
* Control who can access resources (IAM roles).
* Prevent abuse or overuse of APIs via rate limiting/throttling.
* Ensure compliance with security policies.
* Use Cases: Public APIs, microservices, multi-tenant applications.

## How it Works / Steps / Flow

### 1) AWS Shield

* Provides network/transport-level protection (Layer 3 & 4).
* Protects both ALB and NLB from volumetric and protocol-level DDoS attacks.
* Flow: `User → AWS Shield → ALB/NLB → Backend`

### 2) Web Application Firewall (WAF)

* Application-level firewall (Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS).
* Protects ALB (not NLB) from attacks like SQL injection, XSS, malicious bots, and HTTP floods.
* Flow: `User → AWS Shield → WAF → ALB → Backend`
* WAF rules: IP blacklisting, rate limiting, header inspection, geographic restrictions.
* Shields backend from harmful HTTP requests.

### 3) IAM Roles

* Control access to AWS resources for EC2 instances, pods, Lambda, etc.
* No hardcoding of credentials; roles are assumed by services.
* Example: EC2 or pod reads/writes S3 bucket securely using IAM role.

### 4) API Throttling / Rate Limiting

* Limits requests per client per second to prevent abuse.
* Prevents overloading backend and accidental DDoS.
* Example: AWS API Gateway throttle = 100 req/sec, burst handling 200 req/sec.

### Common Attacks (One-line Summary)

* **DDoS** → Overloads servers to make app unavailable.
* **SQL Injection** → Malicious queries to read/modify database.
* **XSS** → Inject scripts to steal user data or sessions.
* **Malicious Bots** → Automated abuse of APIs or scraping data.

## Common Issues

* WAF misconfiguration → blocks legitimate traffic.
* IAM roles missing permissions → 403 errors.
* API throttling too strict → 429 errors.
* Large volumetric DDoS → ALB overwhelmed if Shield not used.

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* WAF: Review logs, adjust rules to avoid false positives.
* IAM: Audit roles with IAM Access Analyzer.
* API throttling: Monitor CloudWatch metrics, adjust thresholds.
* Combine Shield + WAF + Security Groups for layered protection.

## Best Practices / Tips

✅ Apply least privilege using IAM roles.
✅ Use WAF managed rulesets for common attacks.
✅ Implement API throttling to protect backend.
✅ Log requests via CloudWatch/CloudTrail.
✅ Test security rules in staging.
✅ Use Shield + WAF together for ALB to ensure defense in depth.
✅ For NLB, use Shield only (WAF not applicable).

## Real-world Cloud Example

* ALB routes traffic to backend.
* **AWS Shield** mitigates network-level DDoS.
* **AWS WAF** blocks malicious HTTP requests (SQLi, XSS).
* Backend EC2/pods assume IAM roles to access S3 securely.
* API Gateway throttles client requests to prevent abuse.
* CloudWatch monitors metrics, latencies, and security events.

## DevOps Role

* Configure WAF rules and Shield protection.
* Assign and manage IAM roles for pods/EC2/Lambda.
* Implement and monitor API throttling.
* Audit security logs regularly.
* Integrate security with CI/CD pipeline.
* Ensure ALB/NLB protections are correctly applied and tested.

## 2.2 Web Server - Detailed Notes

### Web Server

• **Concept / What:**
A web server is software (and hardware) that serves content over HTTP/HTTPS. It handles client requests for static or dynamic content, either serving it directly or forwarding to backend applications.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Serve content efficiently to clients.
* Offload backend servers by handling static content.
* Enable secure communication via SSL/TLS.
* Act as a reverse proxy to backend applications.
* Provide caching, compression, and centralized logging.

• **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

```
Client (Browser) ──HTTP/HTTPS──► Web Server ──► Static Content
                                  │
                                  └─► Reverse Proxy ──► Backend Application
```

Stepwise:

1. Client sends request to web server.
2. If static, server responds directly.
3. If dynamic, forwards to backend server.
4. Response returns to client via web server.

**AWS/K8s Examples:**

* EC2 with Nginx serving frontend, proxying API calls to Node.js backend.
* S3 + CloudFront for static content.
* Nginx Ingress in Kubernetes routing to multiple services.

• **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Port misconfiguration (80/443)
* Misconfigured SSL/TLS → handshake failures
* Wrong root path → 404 Not Found
* Backend proxy misrouting → 502/504 errors

• **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Check web server logs (`/var/log/nginx/error.log`, `/var/log/httpd/error_log`)
* Verify SSL certificates and ports
* Ensure correct root paths and backend addresses
* Clear cache if static content not updated

• **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Serve static content directly, offloading backend.

---

### Reverse Proxy Configuration to Backend - Notes

• **Concept / What:**
A reverse proxy is a server (like Nginx or Apache) that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the backend and returning responses to clients. Backend servers are hidden from the client.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Load balancing across multiple backend servers
* Security: hide backend servers from direct access
* SSL termination: handle HTTPS at proxy
* Caching and compression to reduce backend load
* Centralized logging for monitoring requests

• **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

1. Client sends request to reverse proxy.
2. Proxy selects backend server (round-robin, least connections, IP hash).
3. Request forwarded to backend.
4. Backend processes request and returns response.
5. Proxy sends response to client.

**Nginx Example:**

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend_servers {
        server 10.0.0.1:3000;
        server 10.0.0.2:3000;
        server 10.0.0.3:3000;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
}
```

• **Common Issues / Errors:**

* 502 Bad Gateway / 504 Gateway Timeout
* Incorrect headers (lost client IP)
* SSL misconfiguration
* Backend unreachable or misconfigured

• **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Check proxy logs
* Verify backend server health and ports
* Ensure `X-Forwarded-For` headers set correctly
* Validate SSL certificates if using HTTPS

• **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Enable health checks for backend servers
* Use sticky sessions if required
* Offload SSL at proxy
* Cache frequently requested content
* Monitor proxy performance and errors

• **DevOps vs Developer Responsibility:**

* **DevOps:** Install and maintain reverse proxy server, implement provided configuration, ensure SSL, connectivity, and performance
* **Developer:** Provide routing rules or backend mapping for proxy

## 2.2 Web Server - SSL/TLS, TLS Handshake, and Termination (Detailed Notes)

### 1️⃣ TLS Encryption

• **Concept / What:**
TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts traffic between client and web server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Protect sensitive data (login forms, API calls, payments)
* Prevent eavesdropping and MITM attacks
* Required for HTTPS

• **How it Works / Flow:**

* Uses symmetric encryption for data transfer
* Keys exchanged securely using asymmetric encryption during TLS handshake

### 2️⃣ TLS Handshake

• **Concept / What:**
Process to establish a secure connection, negotiate encryption, and authenticate server.

• **Steps / Flow:**

1. Client Hello: supported TLS versions, ciphers, random number
2. Server Hello: selected TLS version, cipher, random number
3. Server Certificate: CA-signed certificate sent to client
4. Key Exchange: client/server exchange session keys
5. Handshake Complete: session keys used for encrypted communication

**Diagram:**

```
Client (Browser)
   │
   │--- Client Hello --->
   │<-- Server Hello ----
   │<-- Server Certificate & Key Exchange ---
   │--- Key Exchange ---->
   │<-- Handshake Complete ---
Encrypted HTTPS Communication Begins
```

### 3️⃣ TLS/SSL Termination

• **Concept / What:**

* Web server or reverse proxy decrypts HTTPS traffic.
* **End-to-End TLS:** traffic remains encrypted to backend, backend decrypts TLS.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Offload CPU-intensive encryption from backend (normal termination)
* End-to-End TLS ensures encryption throughout path for sensitive data

• **How it Works / Flow:**

```
Client (HTTPS) ──TLS Handshake──► Web Server ──HTTP──► Backend  (Normal TLS Termination)
Client (HTTPS) ──TLS Handshake──► Web Server ──HTTPS──► Backend  (End-to-End TLS)
```

• **Nginx Example for End-to-End TLS:**

```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
    server 10.0.0.1:443;
    server 10.0.0.2:443;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/example.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/example.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://backend_servers;
        proxy_ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/client.crt;
        proxy_ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/client.key;
        proxy_ssl_verify on;
    }
}
```

### 4️⃣ Certificate Authority (CA) & Certificates

• **Concept / What:**
CA issues digital certificates to verify server identity and enable secure key exchange.

• **Where Stored:**

* **Server directories:** `/etc/ssl/certs/` (certificate), `/etc/ssl/private/` (private key)
* **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** Managed storage, auto-renewal, integrated with ALB/NLB/CloudFront
* **AWS Secrets Manager:** Secure storage for custom/internal certificates, supports rotation

• **How Used in TLS Handshake:**

1. Server sends certificate to client
2. Client verifies against trusted CA list
3. If valid → handshake continues; if invalid → warning/error

• **Best Practices:**

* Use TLS 1.2/1.3 only, strong ciphers
* Store certificates securely; automate renewals
* Offload TLS at web server/load balancer
* Enable HSTS headers
* Prefer ACM or Secrets Manager for automation/security

### 5️⃣ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Cause                             | Fix                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Handshake failure           | Protocol/cipher mismatch          | Update TLS versions/ciphers |
| Expired/invalid certificate | Certificate expired/misconfigured | Renew/replace certificate   |
| Wrong certificate path      | Web server misconfigured          | Correct paths in config     |
| Weak cipher enabled         | Security risk                     | Disable weak ciphers        |

### 6️⃣ DevOps Role

* Install/configure web server/load balancer for TLS termination
* Deploy/manage certificates (ACM, Secrets Manager, or server)
* Monitor TLS handshake logs and troubleshoot errors
* Ensure backend connectivity and optionally enable end-to-end TLS

## 2.2 Web Server – Caching, Compression, and CDN – Detailed Notes

### **Caching (Web Server & CDN)**

• **Concept / What:**
Temporarily store frequently accessed content to reduce backend load and serve faster responses.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Reduce backend server load
* Improve response time and performance
* Enhance scalability and global access (via CDN)

• **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

1. Web Server Cache (NGINX/Apache) stores hot/frequently requested responses locally.
2. CDN (CloudFront, Akamai, etc.) caches content at edge locations near users.
3. Only requested content is cached; less-accessed data is evicted automatically.
4. Cache TTL (Time To Live) controls how long content remains valid.

• **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Cache stale data
* Misconfigured TTL → content outdated or too short-lived
* CDN cache miss → slower response

• **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Invalidate CDN cache on updates
* Adjust TTL and cache keys
* Monitor cache hit ratio and performance metrics

• **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Cache static content fully (images, CSS, JS, videos)
* Cache dynamic content selectively with short TTL
* Use LRU eviction to manage cache size
* Monitor and adjust caching based on traffic patterns

---

### **Compression**

• **Concept / What:**
Reduce the size of responses (HTML, CSS, JS) before sending to clients to save bandwidth and improve load time.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Faster delivery over network
* Lower bandwidth usage
* Improved user experience

• **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

* Enable gzip/brotli modules in NGINX/Apache
* Compress text-based content
* Example (NGINX gzip):

```nginx
http {
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/json;
    gzip_min_length 256;
    gzip_comp_level 5;
}
```

• **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Compression not applied → slow performance
* Wrong MIME type → compression fails

• **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Enable correct modules
* Verify MIME types and headers
* Test with browser dev tools or `curl -I`

• **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Always compress text-based responses
* Combine with caching for best performance
* Monitor CPU usage (compression consumes resources)

---

### **CDN Integration**

• **Concept / What:**
Globally distributed servers that cache and deliver content closer to end-users for faster access.

• **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Reduce latency for global users
* Offload origin servers
* Improve availability and scalability

• **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

1. Configure origin (web server or S3 bucket)
2. Define cache behavior (paths, TTL, compression)
3. Serve users: CDN serves cached content; on cache miss, fetch from origin
4. Only requested content is cached, less accessed content evicted automatically

• **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Incorrect cache policy → stale content
* Misconfigured origin → CDN unable to fetch content
* TTL too long → outdated content served

• **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Invalidate cache for updated content
* Adjust TTL and cache paths
* Ensure origin server is reachable and serving correct headers

• **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Cache static assets extensively (images, CSS, JS)
* Cache dynamic content selectively
* Enable compression at both web server and CDN
* Monitor cache hit/miss ratio for optimization

---

### **DevOps vs Developer Responsibilities**

| Task                                   | DevOps | Developer                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| Install & configure web server         | ✅      | ❌                        |
| Enable caching/compression modules     | ✅      | ❌ (guidance only)        |
| Configure CDN origin & cache policies  | ✅      | ❌ (advise content rules) |
| Provide static content/build artifacts | ❌      | ✅                        |
| Decide cacheable paths, headers, TTL   | ❌      | ✅                        |
| Monitor performance & cache hit ratio  | ✅      | ❌                        |
