i## Monitoring and Logging

---

### **Concept / What:**

Monitoring and Logging together provide observability into systems and applications.

* **Logging:** Records *what happened* in the system — events, errors, and transactions.
* **Monitoring:** Tracks *what is happening right now* — performance, health, and usage metrics.

In short:

> **Logging = History (Past)**
> **Monitoring = Health (Present)**

---

### **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Detect issues before they impact users.
* Debug production incidents using logs.
* Analyze performance trends and capacity.
* Trigger alerts for threshold breaches.
* Ensure compliance, audit, and RCA (Root Cause Analysis).

These two are the *eyes and ears* of your infrastructure.

---

### **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

#### **Basic Flow:**

```
              ┌────────────────────────────┐
              │         Application        │
              ├────────────┬───────────────┤
              │  Logs      │   Metrics     │
              ▼            ▼               │
       ┌───────────┐   ┌───────────┐       │
       │ Log Agent │   │ Metrics Agent│     │
       └────┬──────┘   └─────┬──────┘       │
            │                │
            ▼                ▼
     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
     │ Log Store  │     │ Monitoring │
     │ (e.g. S3,  │     │ System     │
     │ CloudWatch │     │ (e.g. Grafana│
     │ ELK Stack) │     │ CloudWatch) │
     └────┬───────┘     └──────┬─────┘
          │                    │
          ▼                    ▼
   ┌──────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
   │  Visualization│     │ Alert System  │
   │ (Kibana, etc.)│     │ (SNS, PagerDuty)│
   └──────────────┘     └───────────────┘
```

#### **How CloudWatch Collects Application Logs:**

1. **Install CloudWatch Agent** on EC2:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
   ```

2. **Attach IAM Role** to EC2 with permissions:

   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
       "logs:CreateLogGroup",
       "logs:CreateLogStream",
       "logs:PutLogEvents"
     ],
     "Resource": "*"
   }
   ```

3. **Configure the Agent** (`/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "logs": {
       "logs_collected": {
         "files": {
           "collect_list": [
             {
               "file_path": "/var/log/app/access.log",
               "log_group_name": "EcommerceApp-AccessLogs",
               "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}-access"
             },
             {
               "file_path": "/var/log/app/error.log",
               "log_group_name": "EcommerceApp-ErrorLogs",
               "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}-error"
             }
           ]
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Start the Agent:**

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
     -a fetch-config -m ec2 \
     -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json -s
   ```

5. **Verify** logs appear in CloudWatch Console → Log Groups.

#### **For Containers (ECS/EKS):**

Use **Fluent Bit / FluentD** as a DaemonSet:

```yaml
[OUTPUT]
    Name cloudwatch_logs
    Match *
    log_group_name app-logs
    log_stream_prefix from-fluentbit-
```

#### **For Lambda:**

Logs are automatically sent to CloudWatch — no configuration needed.

---

### **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Logs not appearing → Agent misconfiguration or missing IAM role.
* High log ingestion cost → Uncontrolled verbosity or debug logs.
* Delayed logs → Network issues or agent buffer delays.

---

### **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Check `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log` for agent errors.
* Use `sudo systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent` to ensure it’s running.
* Verify IAM role permissions.
* Reduce log level (from DEBUG → INFO) to cut cost.

---

### **Best Practices / Tips:**

* **Centralize all logs** in CloudWatch or ELK.
* **Use structured logging (JSON)** for better querying.
* **Set retention policies** to control cost.
* **Integrate CloudWatch with SNS/PagerDuty** for proactive alerting.
* **Correlate logs, metrics, and traces** (X-Ray / OpenTelemetry) for full observability.
* **Use S3 archival** for long-term storage.

---

### **AWS Example Summary:**

* **CloudWatch Metrics** → Monitor CPU, memory, latency.
* **CloudWatch Logs** → Store application/system logs.
* **X-Ray** → Trace end-to-end requests.
* **SNS / PagerDuty** → Trigger alerts.

---

### **Analogy to Prometheus Setup:**

Just like **Node Exporter** acts as an agent between nodes and Prometheus (exporting metrics),
**CloudWatch Agent** acts as an agent between your EC2/application and CloudWatch (pushing logs + metrics directly).

> Node Exporter exposes data for Prometheus to *scrape*, while CloudWatch Agent *pushes* data directly to CloudWatch.

## Frontend Logging (Errors, Asset Load Times)

---

### **Concept / What:**

Frontend logging is the process of collecting logs, performance data, and errors that occur in the **user’s browser or client-side layer** (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

* Captures JavaScript errors, API failures, asset load performance, user interactions, and custom events.
* Helps understand **how the application behaves from the user's perspective**.

---

### **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Detect UI issues like broken scripts, non-functional buttons, or rendering errors.
* Track **performance bottlenecks** (slow asset loads, page render times).
* Analyze user interactions for **UX optimization**.
* Support **data-driven decisions** by analyzing frontend behavior.

*Example Use Case:*

* E-commerce site: Users report “Add to Cart” not working → JS error is logged → debug using frontend logs.

---

### **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

#### **Flow:**

```
[User Browser]
     ↓
Frontend SDK (Sentry / CloudWatch RUM)
     ↓
Collect JS errors, performance metrics, API failures, interactions
     ↓
Send to Monitoring Backend (Sentry, CloudWatch, Datadog)
     ↓
Centralized Dashboard → Alerts → Analysis
```

#### **AWS CloudWatch RUM Setup:**

1. **Navigate CloudWatch Console → Application Monitoring → RUM**
2. **Create App Monitor:**

   * Provide name and domain
   * Configure sampling rates
   * Set allowed domains
3. **Integrate JS snippet** in frontend app

   * Options: NPM package or CDN link
4. **Verify Dashboard**: Metrics and logs appear in CloudWatch

#### **Collected Data via RUM:**

* Page load times, navigation timings
* JS errors
* API/network failures
* Browser/device info
* Custom user-defined events

---

### **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Too many logs → high network usage or slow app
* Sensitive data leaking in logs (PII)
* Script or SDK initialization errors
* Logs blocked by ad blockers or browser restrictions

---

### **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Mask PII before sending logs
* Ensure SDK/script loads after app initialization
* Enable retries for failed log submissions
* Monitor script load times to avoid slowing app

---

### **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Use **structured logging (JSON)** for easier filtering and analysis
* Set **log levels** (error, warn, info) carefully
* **Sample logs** for high-traffic apps to control volume and cost
* Integrate with backend logs for **end-to-end visibility**
* Set **alerts on metrics** (CloudWatch alarms, SNS, PagerDuty)
* Archive logs for long-term analysis (S3 or ELK)

---

### **AWS Example Summary:**

| Component          | Purpose                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| CloudWatch RUM     | Frontend logs and performance metrics |
| CloudWatch Metrics | Real-time monitoring of app health    |
| CloudWatch Alarms  | Trigger alerts on thresholds          |

---

### **Analogy:**

* **NodeExporter → Prometheus (metrics)**
* **CloudWatch Agent / RUM → CloudWatch (frontend logs + metrics)**

NodeExporter exposes metrics → Prometheus scrapes them.
CloudWatch RUM collects logs and metrics → pushes them to CloudWatch dashboards.

---
---

## Backend Logs and Metrics (Detailed Explanation)

---

### **Concept / What:**

Backend logging and metrics involve collecting **server-side events, performance data, and system metrics** generated by applications, databases, and infrastructure.

* **Logs:** Capture errors, warnings, info events (exceptions, failed API calls, user activity).
* **Metrics:** Quantitative data about system health and performance (CPU, memory, request rate, DB query time, latency).

---

### **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

* Debug backend issues (exceptions, downtime).
* Monitor system health and performance in real time.
* Detect anomalies early via alerts.
* Audit and compliance tracking.
* Analyze user behavior and application performance.

*Example Use Case:*

* Java backend service logs `NullPointerException` in CloudWatch Logs.
* Metrics like request rate, error rate, and latency are tracked in CloudWatch Metrics for alerts.

---

### **How it Works / Steps / Flow:**

```
[Backend Server / App]
      ↓
Generate Logs & Metrics
      ↓
CloudWatch Agent / SDK / Embedded Metrics Format (EMF)
      ↓
CloudWatch Logs → Log Groups & Streams
CloudWatch Metrics → Dashboards & Alarms
      ↓
Alerts / Visualization / Analytics
```

**AWS Tools & Methods:**

* **CloudWatch Logs:** Stores backend log files.
* **CloudWatch Metrics:** Tracks performance data.
* **Embedded Metrics Format (EMF):** Send metrics along with logs in structured JSON.
* **CloudWatch Alarms:** Trigger notifications on threshold breaches.

**Java Example (Sending Custom Metric via EMF):**

```java
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.cloudwatch.CloudWatchClient;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.cloudwatch.model.PutMetricDataRequest;

// Send custom metric
```

* Applications on **EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS** can send logs/metrics via CloudWatch Agent, SDK, or FluentD/FluentBit.

---

### **Common Issues / Errors:**

* Missing logs due to misconfigured agent or IAM permissions.
* Metrics not reported due to wrong namespace or dimensions.
* Excessive logging → high costs.
* Lag or delays in log ingestion.

---

### **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Check CloudWatch Agent logs (`/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/`).
* Verify IAM role permissions for logging/metrics.
* Filter verbosity to control volume.
* Use correct namespace/dimensions for metrics.
* Enable batching/compression to reduce ingestion delays.

---

### **Best Practices / Tips:**

* Use **structured logging (JSON)**.
* Separate **log groups** for different apps/environments.
* Use **custom metrics via EMF** for richer insights.
* Set **CloudWatch alarms** on critical metrics (CPU > 80%, Error rate > 5%).
* Archive logs to **S3 or Glacier**.
* Monitor container workloads with **FluentBit / FluentD DaemonSet** in EKS.
* Track **custom business metrics** (orders processed, cart additions, login failures).
* Include system and application metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network, request count, latency, error rate, DB query times, queue depth.

---

### **AWS Components Summary:**

| Component          | Purpose                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| CloudWatch Logs    | Store backend application logs        |
| CloudWatch Metrics | Track system and application metrics  |
| CloudWatch Alarms  | Alerts on threshold breaches          |
| EMF                | Embed metrics in logs for correlation |

---

### **Interview Tips:**

* Mention metrics beyond CPU/memory: request rate, latency, error rate, DB query times, queue depth, business KPIs.
* Highlight EMF for correlating logs and metrics.
* Show understanding of **monitoring vs logging** and how CloudWatch integrates both.
* Demonstrate proactive monitoring using **CloudWatch Alarms**.

### CloudWatch EMF (Embedded Metric Format) – Detailed Notes

#### 1. Overview

* **EMF (Embedded Metric Format)** is a JSON-based format that allows applications to send custom metrics directly to **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**, which are automatically extracted and published as CloudWatch metrics.
* It’s used for **custom monitoring** – especially for backend applications and microservices.

#### 2. How It Works

* Application sends logs in **EMF JSON structure** to **CloudWatch Logs**.
* CloudWatch service parses the JSON automatically and converts embedded metric data into **CloudWatch metrics**.
* This eliminates the need to use multiple CloudWatch API calls.

#### 3. Example EMF Log

```json
{
  "_aws": {
    "Timestamp": 1663248000000,
    "CloudWatchMetrics": [
      {
        "Namespace": "MyApp/Metrics",
        "Dimensions": [["ServiceName"]],
        "Metrics": [
          {"Name": "RequestLatency", "Unit": "Milliseconds"},
          {"Name": "ErrorCount", "Unit": "Count"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "ServiceName": "OrderService",
  "RequestLatency": 235,
  "ErrorCount": 1
}
```

#### 4. Use Cases

* Monitoring **application-level metrics** such as:

  * API response time
  * Error rates
  * Request count
  * DB query time
  * Cache hit/miss ratio
* Tracking metrics without using the AWS SDK for CloudWatch.

#### 5. Benefits

* Reduces overhead of multiple PutMetricData API calls.
* Integrates with **existing log pipelines**.
* Supports **dynamic dimensions** (example: per microservice, per API endpoint).

#### 6. Real-Time DevOps Use Case

* Example: A backend service writes logs in EMF format.
* CloudWatch automatically extracts and visualizes metrics like:

  * `RequestLatency` (for performance monitoring)
  * `ErrorCount` (for reliability)
  * `DBQueryTime` (for backend DB performance)
* You can set **alarms** on these metrics to get notified before failures.

#### 7. Tools & Integration

* Works well with **AWS Lambda, ECS, EC2, or any custom app**.
* Libraries available for **Java, Python, Node.js** to generate EMF logs.

#### 8. Key Interview Pointers

* EMF helps **embed metrics within logs** — saves cost and simplifies metric publishing.
* Common interview follow-up: *“How do you create custom metrics without using PutMetricData?”* → Answer: “By using EMF.”

# End-to-End Request Tracing

## Detailed Explanation Version

### • Concept / What

End-to-End Request Tracing tracks a **user request from the start (frontend/browser)** to the **final backend system (database, APIs, or external services)** — across all microservices involved. It helps visualize the **entire request path**, including how much time each service takes and where delays or errors occur.

### • Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Identify **bottlenecks** across distributed systems.
* Detect **slow microservices** or failed calls in real time.
* Improve **application performance** and user experience.
* Provide developers and DevOps engineers **root cause visibility** across full request flow.
* Useful in microservices or serverless architectures where requests span multiple components.

**Example:**
A user performs a checkout in an e-commerce site. That single request touches multiple services — cart, payment, inventory, DB, and notification. Tracing lets you see where the latency occurred (e.g., payment API took 3s).

### • How it Works / Steps / Syntax

1. **Instrumentation:**

   * Application code is instrumented to emit trace data.
   * Each request gets a unique `Trace ID` propagated through every service call.

2. **Collection:**

   * Agents or daemons collect trace data (like AWS X-Ray daemon or OpenTelemetry collector).

3. **Storage:**

   * Trace segments are sent to a centralized tracing service (AWS X-Ray, Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, etc.).

4. **Visualization:**

   * Trace maps show each service, timing, and dependencies.

**Simple Flow Diagram:**

```
[User Request]
     ↓
[Frontend Service] --trace_id--> [API Gateway] --trace_id--> [Backend Service A]
                                                   ↓
                                          [Service B] --> [Database]
```

**AWS Example:**

* Use **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing.
* Install **X-Ray agent/daemon** on EC2, ECS, or EKS.
* Developers integrate **X-Ray SDK** in the application.
* Traces appear in **X-Ray console** or **CloudWatch ServiceLens**.

### • DevOps vs Developer Responsibilities

| Role                | Responsibility                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Setup tracing infrastructure (e.g., X-Ray, Jaeger). Configure IAM roles, agents, exporters, and ensure data flow. |
| **Developer**       | Integrate tracing SDK into code, propagate trace headers, and send application-level trace data.                  |

Example:

> DevOps sets up AWS X-Ray Daemon in EKS. Developers add the X-Ray SDK in their Node.js app. Together, they get full trace visibility in CloudWatch ServiceLens.

### • Common Issues / Errors

* **Trace ID not propagated** → missing segments in trace map.
* **Agent misconfigured** → trace data not sent to service.
* **High sampling rate** → unnecessary cost or noise.

### • Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Ensure **trace header** (`X-Amzn-Trace-Id`) is passed between microservices.
* Verify agent or daemon logs for delivery failures.
* Tune sampling rules for performance and cost balance.

### • Best Practices / Tips

* Always use **correlation IDs** in microservice communication.
* Combine **logging + tracing + metrics** for full observability.
* Use **ServiceLens (AWS)** to unify logs, metrics, and traces.
* Restrict sensitive data in traces (PII masking).
* Use **OpenTelemetry** for vendor-neutral instrumentation.

### • Common Interview Follow-ups

1. Difference between **metrics, logs, and traces**?
2. How do you instrument a microservice for tracing?
3. Can you integrate X-Ray with EKS or Lambda?
4. How does X-Ray sampling work?
5. What’s the difference between AWS X-Ray and OpenTelemetry?
6. As a DevOps engineer, which part of tracing setup is your responsibility?
