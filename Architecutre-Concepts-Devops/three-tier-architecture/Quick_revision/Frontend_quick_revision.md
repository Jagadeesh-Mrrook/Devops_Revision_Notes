# Static vs Dynamic Content - Quick Revision

### Concept / What

* Static: Unchanging files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
* Dynamic: Generated per user request (shopping cart, dashboard)

### Why / Use Case

* Static: Fast, cacheable, landing pages, assets
* Dynamic: Personalized content, real-time data

### Deployment Flow

* Static: User â†’ Browser â†’ CDN/S3/Web Server â†’ Files
* Dynamic: User â†’ Browser â†’ Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ DB â†’ Backend â†’ Frontend â†’ Browser

### Common Issues

* Static: Outdated cached files
* Dynamic: Backend bottlenecks, slow DB queries

### Fixes

* Cache invalidation, versioned files, optimize queries, load balancer + auto-scaling, caching layers

### Best Practices

* Serve static via CDN
* Minimize dynamic computation; cache results
* Separate static frontend & dynamic backend
* SPA/frontend calls dynamic APIs for personalization

# UI Assets and Static/Dynamic Content Hosting - Quick Revision

### Concept / What

* UI Assets: HTML, CSS, JS, images, templates
* Static content: Unchanging files (frontend assets)
* Dynamic content: Personalized or real-time data from backend

### Why / Use Case

* UI Assets make frontend interactive and user-friendly
* Static: fast, cacheable, minimal backend load
* Dynamic: real-time user data (cart, orders, product availability)

### Deployment Flow

* Static Assets: Browser â†’ CloudFront â†’ S3 â†’ HTML/CSS/JS/Images
* Dynamic Content: Browser â†’ API calls â†’ EKS Microservices â†’ DB â†’ Response â†’ Browser

### Common Issues

* Static: outdated cache, broken links, wrong MIME types, unoptimized files
* Dynamic: slow API, backend bottlenecks, inconsistent data

### Fixes

* Cache-busting / versioning for static assets
* Optimize images and JS/CSS
* Proper headers for static files
* Backend optimizations, caching, load balancers, auto-scaling

### Best Practices

* Serve static assets via CDN (S3 + CloudFront)
* Separate frontend static assets from dynamic backend microservices
* Automate deployments in CI/CD
* Lazy load images, minify JS/CSS
* SPA frontend calls backend APIs for dynamic content

# Serving Static Content - Quick Revision

### Concept / What

* Static content: HTML, CSS, JS, images, templates
* Hosted for fast, reliable delivery to users

### Why / Use Case

* Low latency, high availability
* Reduces backend load
* SPA frontend uses static assets; dynamic content served by backend

### Deployment Options

1. **S3 + CloudFront**

   * Store in S3, distribute via CloudFront CDN
   * No web servers needed, auto-scaling, cache control
2. **Web server on EC2 / EKS pods**

   * Nginx/Apache serving files, routed via ALB/NLB
   * More control, higher operational overhead

### Common Issues

* Old cached assets
* Wrong MIME types or paths
* Load balancing sync issues

### Fixes

* Versioned file names for cache-busting
* Correct headers and CloudFront invalidation
* Sync files across servers if using EC2/EKS

### Best Practices

* Prefer S3 + CloudFront
* Set caching headers properly
* Automate deployments in CI/CD
* Use compression (gzip, Brotli)

# Frontend Request Flow - Quick Revision

### Concept / What

* Shows how user requests flow from browser/app â†’ frontend SPA â†’ backend services â†’ DB â†’ response.
* SPA fetches static content first, then dynamic content via API calls.

### Flow Summary

1. **DNS Resolution:** [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) â†’ Route 53 alias â†’ CloudFront DNS
2. **Static content:** CloudFront â†’ S3
3. **Dynamic content (API calls):** CloudFront â†’ ALB â†’ EKS Backend â†’ DB
4. **Response:** Back through ALB/CloudFront â†’ Browser

### Key Points

* Browser decides which requests are static vs dynamic.
* CloudFront routes requests to correct origin (S3 or ALB).
* Multiple HTTP requests per page load: static â†’ S3, dynamic â†’ backend.
* ALB IP is never exposed to the browser; browser only sees CloudFront IP.

### Common Issues / Fixes

* **CORS errors** â†’ fix headers in backend
* **Misrouted requests** â†’ verify CloudFront origin/path
* **Slow backend** â†’ monitoring, autoscaling
* **SSL/TLS issues** â†’ proper termination at CloudFront/ALB

### Best Practices

* Decouple frontend and backend; use API calls
* Serve static assets via CloudFront + S3
* Use ALB/Ingress for backend routing
* Enable logging, monitoring, and health checks
* Version static assets to avoid caching issues

# Frontend Pods in Kubernetes - Quick Revision

### Concept / What

* Pods run frontend app (SPA) using Nginx/Apache.
* Serve frontend code; large static assets (images/videos) from S3.

### Flow Summary

1. **Browser â†’ Route 53 â†’ ALB/Ingress â†’ Frontend Pod**
2. **Pod serves HTML/CSS/JS**
3. **Large static assets fetched from S3 â†’ Browser**
4. **Frontend JS â†’ API calls â†’ Backend Pods â†’ DB â†’ Response â†’ Browser**

### Key Points

* Pods handle code and small static content only.
* Large static assets stored in S3.
* Pods need **IAM permissions** (node group role or IRSA) to access S3.
* ALB or Ingress exposes pods externally.

### Common Issues / Fixes

* Misconfigured Ingress â†’ traffic not reaching pods.
* Pod crashes â†’ unavailable frontend.
* S3 access denied â†’ check IAM role.
* SSL/TLS misconfig â†’ ensure correct termination.

### Best Practices

* Multiple replicas for high availability.
* Offload large assets to S3 + CloudFront.
* Use Ingress/ALB for traffic routing.
* Implement liveness/readiness probes.
* Least privilege IAM for S3 access.

# HTTPS and TLS - Quick Revision (DevOps Perspective)

### Concept / What

* HTTPS encrypts browser-server traffic; TLS is the modern protocol.
* Certificates (TLS/SSL) enable encryption and authentication.

### Flow

* Browser encrypts request â†’ TLS â†’ ALB decrypts â†’ HTTP â†’ Backend Pods.
* Optional end-to-end TLS: ALB forwards encrypted request â†’ backend decrypts.

### Termination Options

| Option          | Flow                                     | Pros                | Cons                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| ALB Termination | Internet â†’ HTTPS â†’ ALB â†’ HTTP â†’ Backend  | Less CPU on backend | Data unencrypted inside network |
| End-to-End TLS  | Internet â†’ HTTPS â†’ ALB â†’ HTTPS â†’ Backend | Full encryption     | Higher CPU usage                |

### Certificates

* DV: domain ownership, free/low-cost.
* OV: domain + org verification, paid.
* EV: strict verification, shows org in browser, high cost.
* Wildcard: all subdomains.
* SAN: multiple domains.

### Key DevOps Points

* Store paid/private certificates securely in **AWS Secrets Manager**.
* Use **ACM** for automated certificate management.
* Redirect HTTP â†’ HTTPS; enable **HSTS**.
* Prefer ALB termination unless end-to-end TLS is required for sensitive data.
* Focus on TLS encryption/decryption flow, termination, and certificate security.

# Frontend Common Issues & Troubleshooting

## Quick Revision Version

### ðŸ”¹ Concept

Frontend issues = problems in delivering static/dynamic content smoothly (blocked requests, slow load, stale assets, SSL/DNS errors).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why

* Affects **user experience**.
* DevOps ensures **DNS/CDN/ALB/API configs** + optimization.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How / Key Points

1. **CORS** â†’ Different domains (example.com â†’ api.example.com). Need proper `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers.
2. **Slow Loading** â†’ Large/uncompressed assets, missing CDN.
3. **Caching Issues** â†’ Old JS/CSS due to missing invalidation.
4. **DNS/SSL Issues** â†’ Wrong Route 53 mapping, expired TLS cert.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Common Errors

* `Blocked by CORS policy` â†’ header missing.
* High page latency â†’ unoptimized assets.
* Old content â†’ cache not invalidated.
* SSL error â†’ cert expired/mismatch.
* DNS error â†’ endpoint not resolving.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Fixes
