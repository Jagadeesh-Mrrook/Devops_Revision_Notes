## ðŸš€ Quick Revision â€“ Request & Data Flow

* **Flow:**
  User â†’ Browser/App â†’ DNS Resolution â†’ CDN (for static) / ALB (for dynamic) â†’ WAF â†’ AWS Shield â†’ Target Group â†’ EC2/App Server â†’ Database.

* **CDN (CloudFront):**
  Delivers static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) from edge locations near users.

* **Dynamic Content:**
  Routed via Application Load Balancer (ALB) â†’ forwards traffic to EC2 or containerized app servers.

* **Security Layers:**

  * **AWS Shield:** Protects from DDoS attacks.
  * **AWS WAF:** Filters malicious requests (SQLi, XSS, etc.) before reaching ALB.

### Quick Revision â€“ JSON in Backend

* **Purpose**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used to transfer structured data between frontend and backend systems.
* **Format**: Lightweight, text-based key-value pairs â€” easy for both humans and machines.
* **Usage in Backend**:

  * Receives frontend data in JSON format (e.g., login info, form data).
  * Sends API responses back to frontend as JSON.
  * Stores intermediate configuration or API payloads.
* **Conversion**:

  * Backend frameworks automatically parse JSON to internal objects.
  * Example: In Python (Flask/Django), `request.get_json()` â†’ converts incoming JSON body.
  * In Node.js (Express), `app.use(express.json())` â†’ enables JSON body parsing.
* **Common Use Cases**:

  * API communication (REST APIs send/receive JSON)
  * Configuration files
  * Logging structured data

**Example Flow**:
Frontend â†’ sends JSON â†’ Backend parses it â†’ interacts with DB â†’ returns JSON response.

## Edge Caching and CDN Interaction

### Concept / What

Edge caching is storing content closer to end users at edge servers of a CDN. AWS CloudFront is a fully managed CDN that handles edge servers automatically.

### Why / Purpose

* Reduces latency by serving content from nearby edge locations.
* Offloads origin servers, improving scalability and availability.
* Handles traffic spikes efficiently.

### How it Works / Flow

```
User Browser
     |
     v
+-------------------+
| CDN Edge Location |  <- Edge Cache
+-------------------+
     |
     | Cache Hit -> Serves directly to user
     |
     v Cache Miss
+-------------------+
| Origin Server /   |
| Application Load  |
| Balancer / Backend|
+-------------------+
     |
     v
   Database
```

* Browser requests content (e.g., `/images/logo.png`).
* DNS resolves to nearest CloudFront edge.
* Edge checks cache: serves if hit, fetches from origin if miss.
* Cache is stored temporarily at edge with configured TTL.

### Key Concepts

* TTL (Time to Live) determines how long content stays in cache.
* Cache-Control headers define cache rules.
* Cache invalidation updates outdated content.
* Origin can be S3, ALB, or backend server.
* Lambda@Edge can modify requests/responses at edge.

### DevOps vs Developer Responsibilities

**Developer:**

* Decide what to cache and how long (TTL, headers, invalidation).
* Ensure dynamic content is bypassed or has proper cache rules.

**DevOps:**

* Deploy and maintain CloudFront CDN.
* Ensure origin servers are reachable (S3, ALB, backend).
* Monitor CloudFront metrics via CloudWatch (cache hit ratio, latency, errors).
* Monitor CloudFront logs for cache vs origin requests.
* Maintain security: WAF, AWS Shield, HTTPS/TLS.
* Troubleshoot distribution-level issues (not individual cache entries).

### Trade-offs / Scenarios

| Scenario                | Trade-off                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Very short TTL          | More origin requests, less caching benefit |
| Long TTL                | Risk of serving stale content              |
| Dynamic content caching | Requires smart rules or cache bypass       |
| Large media files       | High caching benefit, reduces origin load  |

### Common Issues / Errors

| Issue                              | Cause                            | Fix                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Cache serving outdated content     | TTL too long or no invalidation  | Configure proper TTL or invalidate cache      |
| CORS errors on cached assets       | Missing CORS headers             | Add headers at origin or edge                 |
| Cache misses for frequent requests | Edge locations not populated yet | Pre-warm cache or use Lambda@Edge to prefetch |

### Best Practices / Tips

âœ… Serve static content through CDN edge servers.
âœ… Use cache-control headers wisely.
âœ… Invalidate cache selectively after updates.
âœ… Use origin failover (CloudFront origin groups).
âœ… Cache only idempotent GET requests for dynamic APIs.
âœ… Monitor cache hit ratio and TTL effectiveness.

### Real-World AWS Example

* Frontend static assets: React app â†’ S3 â†’ CloudFront.
* Dynamic API: `/api/products` â†’ ALB â†’ EKS pods â†’ DB.
* Edge caching: frequently requested images cached at CloudFront edge.
* TTL & invalidation: updated image â†’ invalidate cache â†’ next request serves updated version.
* Security layers: WAF + Shield protect traffic to origin and ALB.

## Quick Revision â€“ Error Handling and Retries

* **What:** Detect and manage errors; retries automatically resend failed requests.

* **Why:** Improve reliability, reduce manual intervention, prevent crashes, graceful degradation.

* **Flow:**

```
Browser â†’ Frontend â†’ CloudFront CDN â†’ ALB/WAF/Shield â†’ Backend â†’ DB
Error detected â†’ Retry/Fallback â†’ Response to user
```

* **Error Codes:**

  * Frontend: network/JS (timeout, CORS)
  * CDN: 503, 504 (edge/origin)
  * Backend: 5xx (500, 502, 503)
  * Database: timeout, deadlock

* **Patterns:** Exponential backoff, circuit breaker, fallback, bulkhead.

* **Best Practices:**

  * Retry idempotent ops only
  * Exponential backoff + jitter
  * Circuit breakers
  * Log failures and retries (CloudWatch/ELK)
  * Graceful degradation
  * Use cache for transient failures

* **Dev Responsibilities:** Implement retry logic, backoff, circuit breakers, fallback, idempotency.

* **DevOps Responsibilities:**

  * Monitor metrics and logs (CloudWatch)
  * Alerting on failures
  * Troubleshoot infrastructure and systemic issues
  * Coordinate with developers for persistent errors

* **AWS Example:** React frontend â†’ CloudFront â†’ ALB â†’ EKS pods â†’ RDS; retries with exponential backoff; circuit breaker prevents continuous retries; CloudWatch monitors errors and metrics.
