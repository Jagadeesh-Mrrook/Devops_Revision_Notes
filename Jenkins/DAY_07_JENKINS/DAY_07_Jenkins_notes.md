### SonarQube Integration

**Concept / What:**
SonarQube is a static code analysis tool that inspects code quality and security vulnerabilities. Jenkins integration automates these scans in CI/CD pipelines.

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Detects bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.
* Ensures consistent code quality across teams.
* Prevents bad code from reaching production using Quality Gates.
* Use Case: Analyzing pull requests to catch issues before merging.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

1. Install SonarQube server (on-prem or cloud).
2. Install `SonarQube Scanner` plugin in Jenkins.
3. Configure SonarQube server URL and authentication token in Jenkins.
4. Configure SonarQube Scanner in Jenkins Global Tool Configuration.
5. Integrate in pipeline:

   * Freestyle Job: Add 'Invoke SonarQube Scanner' build step.
   * Pipeline:

   ```groovy
   withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
       sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
   }
   ```
6. Review results on the SonarQube dashboard.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Authentication failures due to invalid tokens.
* Scanner not found if not configured.
* Multi-module project errors due to misconfigured keys or sources.
* Network issues blocking communication.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

### Detailed Explanation Version

**Concept / What:**

* **Quality Profiles:** Sets of coding rules applied during static code analysis. Examples include no unused variables, no empty catch blocks, naming conventions, and security rules. Predefined profiles exist, and custom profiles can be created for additional security or project-specific rules.
* **Quality Gates:** Conditions a project must meet to be considered high-quality. Examples include code coverage ≥ 80%, duplicated code < 3%, no new critical bugs, and no new vulnerabilities.

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Ensure consistent coding standards across projects and teams.
* Enforce minimum quality before code merging or deployment.
* Reduce technical debt and prevent security risks in production.
* Use Case: PRs are analyzed against Quality Profiles and Quality Gates; pipeline fails if thresholds are not met, preventing poor-quality code from being merged.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

1. Create/select a Quality Profile in SonarQube for the relevant language.
2. Assign or customize rules relevant to your project.
3. Create a Quality Gate with thresholds for metrics like coverage, duplication, or bug counts.
4. Link Quality Gate to the project branch.
5. Run SonarQube scan via Jenkins pipeline.
6. If the Quality Gate fails, the pipeline is marked as failed, stopping deployment.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Rules too strict, causing frequent build failures.
* Incorrect profile linked to the project or branch.
* Misconfigured thresholds causing false positives/negatives.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Adjust rules and thresholds based on project maturity.
* Test Quality Profile on sample code to validate behavior.
* Ensure correct project-branch linkage.

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Maintain separate profiles for different languages or project types.
* Regularly review and update rules to match evolving coding standards.
* Enforce Quality Gates in CI/CD pipelines for early feedback.
* Use realistic thresholds based on historical data to reduce noise.

### Detailed Explanation Version

**Concept / What:**

* PR (Pull Request) Decoration integrates SonarQube analysis results directly into SCM pull requests (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
* Developers and reviewers can see code quality issues, test coverage, and vulnerabilities inline while reviewing the PR.

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Provides immediate feedback on code quality and security.
* Helps developers fix issues before merging into dev/main branches.
* Reduces manual review effort.
* Enforces consistent coding standards across the team.
* Use Case: Feature branch PR is scanned, Quality Gate status and inline comments appear directly in the PR.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

1. **Enable PR Decoration** in SonarQube project settings and configure SCM connection.
2. **Add authentication token** with write permissions to SCM.
3. **Configure Jenkins pipeline** to checkout the PR branch.
4. **Pass PR parameters to SonarQube scanner:**

   * `sonar.pullrequest.key` → PR ID
   * `sonar.pullrequest.branch` → source branch
   * `sonar.pullrequest.base` → target branch
5. **Run SonarQube scan** via Jenkins pipeline (same as regular analysis).
6. **Results appear in PR:** inline comments, Quality Gate status, code metrics.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Authentication/permission issues connecting SonarQube to SCM.
* Misconfigured PR parameters leading to missing or incorrect decoration.
* Overwriting results if multiple PRs are scanned simultaneously.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Verify authentication tokens and permissions.
* Double-check PR parameters in Jenkins pipeline.
* Use unique PR identifiers to avoid collisions.

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Decorate all PRs for early feedback.
* Use Quality Gates to block merges on critical issues.
* Limit decoration to active PRs to save CI/CD resources.
* Keep PR decoration lightweight to reduce pipeline runtime.

### Jenkins – Static Code Analysis Notes

#### 1. Static Code Analysis

* **Concept / What:** Automated inspection of source code to identify code quality issues, bugs, vulnerabilities, and maintainability problems without executing the program.
* **Why / Purpose / Use Case:**

  * Detect issues early in development rather than in production.
  * Ensure adherence to coding standards.
  * Improve overall software quality and maintainability.
  * Identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* **How / Steps / Syntax:**

  1. Integrate a static analysis tool (SonarQube, OWASP Dependency Check, Snyk) into the Jenkins pipeline.
  2. Post code checkout, trigger analysis automatically.
  3. Configure Quality Profiles (rules for code quality) and Quality Gates (thresholds like code coverage, duplication, critical issues).
  4. Use PR Decoration to display results directly in Pull Requests for reviewer visibility.
  5. Optionally, enable incremental scans to analyze only changed code.
* **Common Issues / Errors:**

  * Long scan durations for large codebases.
  * Authentication or plugin compatibility issues.
  * False positives or overly strict rules causing build failures.
* **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

  * Exclude generated code and third-party libraries.
  * Use incremental or parallel scans.
  * Adjust Quality Gate thresholds and Quality Profiles based on team consensus.
  * Ensure plugins are updated and tokens/authentication are correct.
* **Best Practices / Tips:**

  * Run scans early in the CI/CD pipeline.
  * Monitor scan duration and optimize for large projects.
  * Ensure PR Decoration is enabled so reviewers can see results.
  * Collaborate with security teams for dependency scanning and incremental scan configurations.
  * Avoid over-strict rules; balance quality with development velocity.

# OWASP Dependency Check in Jenkins

---

## Detailed Explanation Version

### Concept / What

OWASP Dependency Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool integrated into Jenkins to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependencies (libraries, plugins, modules) used in the codebase.

---

### Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World

* Ensures application dependencies are secure before deployment.
* Automates vulnerability detection in CI/CD pipelines.
* Prevents production deployments with high/critical CVEs.
* Commonly required for security audits and compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO).
* Example: A Java Maven project can be scanned for vulnerable JAR files during build.

---

### How it Works / Steps / Syntax

**1. Install OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin in Jenkins:**

* Navigate to **Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available → Search 'OWASP Dependency-Check' → Install**.

**2. Configure Global Tool:**

* Go to **Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration → Dependency-Check installations**.
* Add installation name and choose install automatically.

**3. Pipeline Integration Example:**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/example/repo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Dependency-Check Scan') {
            steps {
                dependencyCheck additionalArguments: '--format XML --prettyPrint',
                                outdir: 'dependency-check-report',
                                scanpath: '.'
            }
        }
        stage('Publish Report') {
            steps {
                dependencyCheckPublisher pattern: 'dependency-check-report/dependency-check-report.xml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**4. Reports Generated:**

* HTML or XML reports under `dependency-check-report/`.
* Visible in Jenkins build job UI.

---

### Common Issues / Errors

* **Database update failure:** Vulnerability database not updated (due to network/firewall).
* **Large scan times:** Too many dependencies or scanning entire workspace.
* **Report not generated:** Wrong output directory or missing arguments.
* **Pipeline failure:** Build fails if CVEs cross severity threshold.

---

### Troubleshooting / Fixes

* Check Jenkins has outbound internet to NVD database.
* Use `dependencyCheck additionalArguments: '--updateonly'` to update DB separately.
* Configure proxy in Jenkins if behind firewall.
* Restrict scan path to only `src/` or dependency directories.
* Adjust severity thresholds using arguments (`--failOnCVSS 7`).

---

### Best Practices / Tips

* Run DB update as a scheduled job (nightly) to reduce build delays.
* Fail builds only for **high/critical CVEs**, not all.
* Archive reports for compliance audits.
* Integrate notifications (Slack/Email) for failed security checks.
* Use with other security tools (SonarQube, Trivy) for full coverage.
