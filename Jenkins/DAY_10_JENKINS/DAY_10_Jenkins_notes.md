## 🧩 Jenkins Shared Library — Using Resource Scripts and Utilities

### 📘 Overview

A Shared Library in Jenkins allows you to **centralize common pipeline logic** and reuse it across multiple Jenkinsfiles. It keeps pipelines **clean, modular, and easy to maintain**.

---

### 🗂️ Directory Structure

```
jenkins-shared-library/
├── vars/
│   ├── buildPipeline.groovy
│   ├── deployPipeline.groovy
│   └── utilities.groovy
├── resources/
│   ├── build.sh
│   ├── test.sh
│   └── deploy.sh
└── src/ (optional)
```

**Explanation:**

* `vars/` → Stores reusable pipeline entry points (each `.groovy` = one global variable available in Jenkins).
* `resources/` → Stores external files like shell scripts, YAMLs, or templates.
* `src/` → (Optional) For advanced Groovy classes or helper logic.
* `utilities.groovy` → A helper file containing reusable functions like executing resource scripts.

---

# 🧩 Jenkins Shared Library — `vars/utilities.groovy`

```groovy
def call() {
    echo "Utilities loaded successfully."
}

// Simple helper: run the .sh script that matches the .groovy filename
def autoRun(scriptBaseName) {
    def scriptPath = "scripts/${scriptBaseName}.sh"
    echo "Running script: ${scriptPath}"

    def scriptContent = libraryResource(scriptPath)
    writeFile file: "${scriptBaseName}.sh", text: scriptContent
    sh "chmod +x ${scriptBaseName}.sh"
    sh "./${scriptBaseName}.sh"
}
```

---

# 🧠 Line-by-Line Explanation

### 🟩 Line 1–3

```groovy
def call() {
    echo "Utilities loaded successfully."
}
```

* `def call()` — defines a **default entry point** in the shared library file.
  When you use `utilities()` inside a Jenkinsfile, Jenkins automatically executes this block.
* The `echo` statement prints a confirmation message showing that the utilities library was loaded correctly.

🧩 Example output:

```
Utilities loaded successfully.
```

This acts like a sanity check to confirm your shared library is available.

---

### 🟩 Line 6

```groovy
def autoRun(scriptBaseName) {
```

* Defines a **custom function** named `autoRun`.
* It takes one argument → `scriptBaseName`.
* This parameter is the base name of the script you want to run (without `.sh`).

🧩 Example:
If you call `utilities.autoRun('build')`, then `scriptBaseName = 'build'`.

---

### 🟩 Line 7

```groovy
def scriptPath = "scripts/${scriptBaseName}.sh"
```

* Builds the **relative path** to your shell script stored in the shared library resources.
* `${scriptBaseName}` dynamically inserts the script name passed earlier.

🧩 Example:
If `scriptBaseName = 'deploy'`, then this becomes:

```
scripts/deploy.sh
```

This is where Jenkins will look for your script in the shared library’s `resources` directory.

---

### 🟩 Line 8

```groovy
echo "Running script: ${scriptPath}"
```

* Prints the name/path of the script being executed to the Jenkins console.
* Helps you confirm which specific `.sh` file is running during each stage.

🧩 Example output:

```
Running script: scripts/build.sh
```

---

### 🟩 Line 10

```groovy
def scriptContent = libraryResource(scriptPath)
```

* `libraryResource()` is a built-in Jenkins function that fetches files from your shared library’s `resources` directory.
* Instead of returning a file, it gives you the **file content as text**.
* So, `scriptContent` now stores everything inside `resources/scripts/<scriptName>.sh`.

🧩 Example:
If your `resources/scripts/build.sh` contains:

```bash
echo "Building the app"
```

then `scriptContent = 'echo "Building the app"'`

---

### 🟩 Line 11

```groovy
writeFile file: "${scriptBaseName}.sh", text: scriptContent
```

* Creates a **new file** in the Jenkins workspace (the agent machine where the job runs).
* `file:` → specifies the filename (for example, `build.sh`).
* `text:` → specifies the content to write into that file (from `scriptContent`).

🧩 Linux Analogy:
It’s like doing:

```bash
touch build.sh
cat > build.sh <<EOF
echo "Building the app"
EOF
```

So Jenkins both creates and fills the file in one command.

---

### 🟩 Line 12

```groovy
sh "chmod +x ${scriptBaseName}.sh"
```

* Runs a shell command (`sh`) on the Jenkins agent.
* Gives **execute permission** to the file so it can be run as a script.

🧩 Equivalent Linux command:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

Without this, Jenkins would throw a *Permission denied* error when trying to run the script.

---

### 🟩 Line 13

```groovy
sh "./${scriptBaseName}.sh"
```

* Executes the newly created shell script in the current directory.
* Jenkins runs it exactly like you would in a terminal.
* Any logs or `echo` statements from inside the script appear in Jenkins console output.

🧩 Example:

```bash
./build.sh
```

If `build.sh` has `echo "Build complete"`, Jenkins console will display:

```
Build complete
```

---

# ✅ Overall Flow Summary

When you call `utilities.autoRun('build')`, Jenkins performs these steps:

1. Builds the path → `scripts/build.sh`
2. Fetches the file content from shared library resources.
3. Writes it to a real file in the workspace (`build.sh`).
4. Makes it executable (`chmod +x build.sh`).
5. Executes it (`./build.sh`).

🧩 Jenkins Console Output Example:

```
Utilities loaded successfully.
Running script: scripts/build.sh
Building the app
Build complete
```

---

### 🔧 buildPipeline.groovy

In real-world Jenkinsfiles, **you shouldn’t define full `pipeline {}` or `stage {}` blocks** inside shared libraries. The shared library should only define the **logic** that runs inside stages.

```groovy
// vars/buildPipeline.groovy
def call() {
    echo "Executing build steps..."
    utilities.runScript('build.sh')
    echo "Executing test steps..."
    utilities.runScript('test.sh')
}
```

---

### 🚀 deployPipeline.groovy

```groovy
// vars/deployPipeline.groovy
def call() {
    echo "Executing deployment steps..."
    utilities.runScript('deploy.sh')
}
```

---

### 📃 Example Shell Scripts

`resources/build.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running build..."
# Add your actual build commands here
echo "Build completed!"
```

`resources/test.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running tests..."
# Add test commands here
echo "Tests passed!"
```

`resources/deploy.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying application..."
# Add deployment commands here
echo "Deployment successful!"
```

---

## 🧩 Jenkinsfile Example

```groovy
@Library('jenkins-shared-library') _

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build and Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Calls the buildPipeline() from vars/build.groovy
                    buildPipeline()
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Calls the deployPipeline() from vars/deploy.groovy
                    deployPipeline()
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            echo "Pipeline execution completed."
        }
    }
}

```
### ✅ Key Point:** Only one `pipeline {}` and set of `stage {}` blocks should exist — in your Jenkinsfile.

## ⚙️ How to Configure Shared Library in Jenkins

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins → Configure System**.
2. Scroll to **Global Pipeline Libraries**.
3. Add a new library:

   * **Name:** `jenkins-shared-library`
   * **Default version:** `main` (or branch name)
   * **Source Code Management:** Git
   * Provide your Git repo URL.
4. Save the configuration.

---

### 👤 How It All Connects

1. Jenkins loads the shared library from the configured Git repo.
2. Jenkinsfile calls `buildPipeline()` and `deployPipeline()`.
3. These call `utilities.runScript()` to execute corresponding shell scripts from `resources/`.

---

### 📈 Benefits

* Keeps Jenkinsfiles clean and modular.
* Centralizes logic for easy maintenance.
* Avoids duplicate shell logic across teams.
* Scalable and reusable.

---

### 🛰️ Summary

| Component          | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `vars/`            | Contains Groovy logic files (build, deploy, etc.)  |
| `resources/`       | Contains external scripts or templates             |
| `utilities.groovy` | Helper for reusable operations                     |
| `Jenkinsfile`      | Defines stages, and calls shared library functions |

This ensures a **modular, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)** and **production-safe** Jenkins setup.

---
---


## ⚙️ Configuring Jenkins Shared Library in Jenkins UI

### Step 1️⃣ — Add the Shared Library in Jenkins

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins → System → Global Pipeline Libraries**.

2. Click **Add**.

3. Fill in the details:

   * **Name:** `jenkins-shared-library` (this will be used in `@Library()` annotation).
   * **Default version:** `main` or any Git branch you want.
   * **Retrieval method:** `Modern SCM`.
   * **Source Code Management:** Choose **Git**.
   * **Repository URL:**
     e.g. `https://github.com/org/jenkins-shared-library.git`
   * Optionally, set **Credentials** if your repo is private.

4. Click **Save**.

---

## 🧩 Using the Shared Library in Jenkinsfile

You can use your shared library in two ways:

### ✅ Option 1 — **Declarative Pipeline**

```groovy
@Library('jenkins-shared-library') _
buildPipeline()
deployPipeline()
```

**Explanation:**

* `@Library('jenkins-shared-library')` → loads the shared library by name (same as configured in Jenkins).
* `_` (underscore) → required to initialize the library in declarative pipelines.
* `buildPipeline()` and `deployPipeline()` are global variables from the `vars/` directory.

---

### ✅ Option 2 — **Declarative Pipeline (With Stages)**

```groovy
@Library('jenkins-shared-library') _

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    utilities.runScript('build.sh')
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    utilities.runScript('test.sh')
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    utilities.runScript('deploy.sh')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 🧰 Notes

* If you have multiple libraries, you can load them like:

  ```groovy
  @Library(['jenkins-shared-library', 'aws-helpers']) _
  ```

* You can also load dynamically within a script:

  ```groovy
  library 'jenkins-shared-library'
  ```

* The library name must match the one configured in **Manage Jenkins → Global Pipeline Libraries**.

# Jenkinsfile Linting & Validation

---

## 🧠 **Concept / What**

**Jenkinsfile linting and validation** ensure that your Jenkins pipeline code is syntactically correct and follows proper structure before execution.
Linting checks for errors like missing brackets, invalid stage syntax, or wrong block placement in declarative pipelines.

---

## 🎯 **Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World**

* Prevents runtime build failures caused by syntax or structural errors in Jenkinsfiles.
* Saves time and debugging effort before the pipeline is executed.
* Ensures pipeline code quality, consistency, and maintainability.
* Used by DevOps teams as part of **pre-commit checks** or **CI/CD stages**.
* Commonly done using **Jenkins web UI**, **API endpoint**, or **automated pipeline stages**.

---

## ⚙️ **How it Works / Steps / Syntax**

### 1️⃣ **Manual Linting using Jenkins URL**

Jenkins provides a built-in endpoint:

```
<JENKINS_URL>/pipeline-model-converter/validate
```

#### Steps:

1. Go to Jenkins URL → append `/pipeline-model-converter/validate`
2. Paste your Jenkinsfile code in the text box.
3. Click **Validate** → Jenkins will return syntax validation output.

> 🧩 Works only where Jenkins is accessible — you can access it from any system that can reach the Jenkins URL (not necessarily the Jenkins master/agent itself).

---

### 2️⃣ **Automated Linting Stage in CI/CD Pipeline**

Even if manual linting is done, real-world setups often include a **linting stage** inside the CI/CD pipeline for:

* Continuous validation
* Security & compliance tracking
* Record maintenance of lint results

#### Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Lint Jenkinsfile') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'curl -X POST -F "jenkinsfile=<Jenkinsfile" http://<jenkins-url>/pipeline-model-converter/validate'
        }
      }
    }

    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building application...'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures:

* Jenkinsfile is validated on every commit.
* No developer can push invalid pipeline code.
* Linting results appear in build logs for auditing.

---

## ⚠️ **Common Issues / Errors**

| Issue                         | Description                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid directive             | Wrongly placed `environment`, `stages`, or `steps` block. |
| Missing braces or parentheses | Syntax formatting errors in declarative pipeline.         |
| Wrong parameter name          | Unsupported or misspelled parameter in stage.             |
| File not found                | Jenkinsfile not available in workspace during lint check. |
| HTTP 403 / 404                | Jenkins URL or permissions incorrect.                     |

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting / Fixes**

* Verify that Jenkinsfile is in the correct repo path and branch.
* Ensure Jenkins user running validation has access permissions.
* Double-check closing braces `{}` and pipeline structure.
* Use VS Code extensions or Jenkins Linter plugins for local syntax checking.
* Validate Jenkinsfile via Jenkins web UI before committing to avoid build failures.

---

## 💡 **Best Practices / Tips**

* Always lint Jenkinsfiles before pushing to main branch.
* Integrate linting as an early stage in CI/CD to catch syntax issues quickly.
* Use meaningful error messages when validation fails.
* Maintain Jenkinsfile templates and shared libraries to standardize structure.
* Restrict direct modifications on production pipelines — enforce linting checks via PR validation.

## ⚙️ Jenkins – Dynamic Parameters in Declarative Pipeline

### 🧩 What Are Dynamic Parameters

Dynamic parameters allow you to **change parameter values at runtime** — for example, loading environments, versions, or regions dynamically instead of hardcoding them.

These are achieved using the **Active Choices** and **Active Choices Reactive Parameters** plugins.

---

### 🔌 Required Plugins

1. **Active Choices Plugin**
2. **Active Choices Reactive Parameter Plugin**

---

### 🏗️ Where to Define Parameters

In a **Declarative Jenkinsfile**, you define parameters **inside the `pipeline` block**, but **before** the `stages` section.

✅ Correct order:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    parameters {
        // Dynamic or Static parameters here
    }

    stages {
        // Pipeline stages
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 Example: Dynamic Parameters in Action

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    parameters {
        choice(
            name: 'ENV',
            choices: ['dev', 'staging', 'prod'],
            description: 'Select target environment'
        )

        activeChoiceReactiveParam('APP_TYPE') {
            description('Select application type based on environment')
            choiceType('SINGLE_SELECT')
            groovyScript {
                script('return ["frontend", "backend", "database"]')
                fallbackScript('return ["none"]')
            }
        }
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "Building for ${params.ENV} with ${params.APP_TYPE}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🧩 Explanation

* **`choice`** → static dropdown list.
* **`activeChoiceReactiveParam`** → dropdown list whose values depend on another parameter.
* **`groovyScript`** → defines how values are generated dynamically.
* **`fallbackScript`** → backup values if the main script fails.

---

### ✅ Real-Time Example

* User selects **Environment → "prod"**.
* Jenkins dynamically shows only **Prod-specific application types** in the next dropdown.

This helps teams deploy to different environments **without modifying the Jenkinsfile** every time.

## Pipeline Input Steps for Approvals

### 🧠 Detailed Explanation Version

#### **Concept / What:**

The **Input Step** in Jenkins Declarative Pipeline is used to pause the pipeline and wait for human approval before proceeding. It allows manual intervention points during automated pipelines.

#### **Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Used for **manual approvals** before deploying to production or sensitive environments.
* Ensures **change control and accountability**.
* Common in multi-stage pipelines — e.g., after testing and before production deploy.
* Can restrict who can approve (submitters) and even **record who approved** for audit purposes.

#### **How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

There are two ways to use the input step in Declarative Pipelines:

---

##### **1️⃣ Simple Manual Approval (inside `steps`)**

```groovy
stage('Approval') {
  steps {
    input message: 'Proceed to Deploy?', submitter: 'admin,manager'
  }
}
```

✅ Jenkins pauses execution and shows an approval button.

* Only users listed under `submitter` can approve.
* Once approved, the next stage continues.
* Does **not record** who approved.

---

##### **2️⃣ Approval + Capture Approver Info (inside `script {}`)**

```groovy
stage('Approval') {
  steps {
    script {
      APPROVER = input(
        message: 'Deploy to Production?',
        ok: 'Approve',
        submitter: 'admin,manager,devops',
        submitterParameter: 'APPROVED_BY'
      )
      echo "Deployment approved by: ${APPROVED_BY}"
    }
  }
}
```

✅ Jenkins prompts for approval and stores **who approved** in the variable `APPROVER`.

* Use this method when you want to record approver names or apply conditional logic.

---

#### **Common Issues / Errors:**

* ❌ *Error:* "Only certain users can approve" → The logged-in user is not listed under `submitter`.
* ❌ *Error:* "input step cannot be used in non-interactive environment" → Happens if pipeline runs in a non-interactive agent or in batch mode.
* ❌ *Timeouts:* If the input step waits too long, Jenkins may abort depending on configured timeouts.

---

#### **Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Ensure correct usernames or group names are used under `submitter`.
* Avoid placing input steps inside parallel stages — approvals don’t behave well in parallel.
* Use the `timeout` block to control waiting time:

  ```groovy
  stage('Approval') {
    steps {
      timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
        input message: 'Proceed with deployment?', submitter: 'admin'
      }
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### **Best Practices / Tips:**

* ✅ Always specify `submitter` to restrict access.
* ✅ Use `submitterParameter` when audit tracking is required.
* ⚙️ Keep input steps outside of parallel stages.
* 🕒 Add a timeout to avoid stuck builds.
* 🧾 Use `script {}` version if you want to log who approved or branch logic based on approver.

---

### ⚡ Quick Revision Version

#### **Concept:**

Input Step pauses Jenkins pipeline for manual approval.

#### **Why:**

Used to control sensitive actions (e.g., production deployment) and ensure authorized approval.

#### **How / Syntax:**

* Simple approval:

  ```groovy
  steps {
    input message: 'Proceed?', submitter: 'admin'
  }
  ```
* Record approver:

  ```groovy
  script {
    APPROVER = input(message: 'Deploy?', submitter: 'admin', submitterParameter: 'APPROVED_BY')
    echo "Approved by ${APPROVER}"
  }
  ```

#### **Common Issues:**

* Unauthorized user tries to approve → access denied.
* Timeout or non-interactive environment error.

#### **Troubleshooting:**

* Verify usernames.
* Add timeout block.
* Avoid parallel usage.

#### **Best Practices:**

* Always restrict submitters.
* Use `script {}` if you need to capture approver.
* Add timeout to prevent hangs.
* Don’t use inside parallel blocks.

## 🧩 Jenkins Matrix Build

### 🔹 What is a Matrix Build?

* Jenkins **Matrix Build** is used to run the **same stage or set of stages across multiple environments/configurations** (e.g., different OS, JDK versions, or agent labels).
* It allows **parallel execution** of jobs with different combinations of parameters.
* Commonly used when QA or developers need to **test the same code on multiple platforms**.

---

### 🔹 Real-Time Scenario Explanation

Jagga explained it like this:

> We have a Jenkinsfile used to deploy applications onto Ubuntu servers via Kubernetes. Now, testers want to test the same application on multiple OS versions (like CentOS, Amazon Linux, or Windows) and with different Java versions (like JDK 17 or 21). Instead of writing separate pipelines for each environment, we can use the matrix build so that the same pipeline runs across all these combinations simultaneously.

✅ Correct — this is exactly what the matrix build achieves.

The matrix build helps when the **same Jenkins pipeline** needs to run on **different agents (OS types)** or **software configurations (like JDK versions)**. Jenkins will **dynamically pick the required agents** that match the configuration and run all combinations in parallel.

---

### 🔹 Discussion on Agent Relation

Jagga asked:

> Are these OS and JDK versions related to agents or to EKS clusters?

Answer:

* They are related to **Jenkins agents**, not to EKS clusters.
* The matrix build runs the same job across **different Jenkins agents** that have the respective environments configured (like Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).
* EKS clusters are deployment environments — Jenkins doesn’t directly change those through matrix builds. Instead, Jenkins tests the code in multiple agent environments before deploying to EKS.

---

### 🔹 Further Clarification

Jagga said:

> Jenkins is not for checking the code. It’s used for deployment. QA engineers will do testing in their environments. But if they want different OS or Java versions, DevOps must provide infrastructure. How can we change that infrastructure in the Jenkins pipeline?

Explanation:

* Jenkins doesn’t change infrastructure automatically.
* Instead, **matrix builds let Jenkins use existing agents** configured for different OS/JDKs.
* So DevOps engineers just ensure Jenkins has those agents available. Jenkins will automatically distribute parallel jobs across those agents using the matrix definition.

---

### 🔹 Matrix Build – Simplified Definition

Jagga summarized:

> Matrix builds are related to Jenkins Agents. Normally, we use `agent none` and specify different agents in each stage. But with matrix builds, Jenkins can automatically run the same pipeline on multiple agents with different configurations. This avoids manual agent assignment.

✅ Correct — that’s exactly right.

The only small gap was that Jenkins doesn’t automatically *detect* or *create* agents; it only **selects existing agents** that match the defined labels or configurations.

---

### 🔹 Matrix Build Key Blocks

| Block      | Description                                                                                           | Analogy (like `stages` syntax)              | Example                                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **matrix** | Main container defining combinations of parameters for parallel runs.                                 | Like `stages { ... }`                       | `matrix { axes { ... } stages { ... } }`                 |
| **axes**   | Holds multiple parameters (each defined as an `axis`).                                                | Like multiple `stage` blocks under `stages` | `axes { axis { name 'OS'; values 'ubuntu', 'centos' } }` |
| **axis**   | Defines a single variable and its possible values. Jenkins forms all possible combinations from them. | Like a single `stage` definition            | `axis { name 'JDK'; values '17', '21' }`                 |

---

### 🔹 Example

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent none
  stages {
    stage('Matrix Build Example') {
      matrix {
        axes {
          axis {
            name 'OS'
            values 'ubuntu', 'centos'
          }
          axis {
            name 'JDK'
            values '17', '21'
          }
        }
        stages {
          stage('Build & Test') {
            agent { label "${OS}" }
            steps {
              echo "Running on OS: ${OS} with JDK: ${JDK}"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 🔹 What Happens Internally

* Jenkins **creates all possible combinations** of defined axes.
* Example: For OS = ubuntu, centos and JDK = 17, 21 → Jenkins creates 4 parallel runs:

  * Ubuntu + JDK 17
  * Ubuntu + JDK 21
  * CentOS + JDK 17
  * CentOS + JDK 21
* Each runs **in parallel** on agents matching the label (Ubuntu/CentOS).

---

### 🔹 Real-World Usage

* Testing applications on different OS/JDK versions simultaneously.
* Ensures compatibility before deployment.
* Saves time by avoiding separate builds.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* `matrix` → defines the multi-environment build logic.
* `axes` → groups all configuration parameters.
* `axis` → defines each environment variable and its values.
* Jenkins runs **all possible combinations** in parallel on available agents.

# 🧩 Parallel Job Execution Across Agents

## Concept / What

Parallel job execution in Jenkins allows multiple stages or tasks within the same pipeline to run **simultaneously** instead of sequentially.
When configured to run **across different agents**, Jenkins can distribute these parallel tasks to multiple nodes (Linux, Windows, etc.) — making the overall pipeline faster and more efficient.

Simply put:
🔗 It’s about running multiple independent jobs or stages **at the same time** across **different Jenkins agents**.

---

## Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World

* **Faster execution:** Reduces build time by executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
* **Multi-environment testing:** You can run the same tests or deployments on multiple environments (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows) at once.
* **Tool/version validation:** Helps QA or DevOps teams validate compatibility across multiple versions (e.g., JDK 11, 17, 21).
* **Distributed workload:** Efficiently uses Jenkins nodes to prevent overloading a single machine.
* **Real-world use case:**
  Suppose a QA team needs to verify a Java app on **three OS types**. You can create a single Jenkins pipeline where:

  * Stage 1 → Builds the artifact
  * Stage 2 → Runs **tests in parallel** on Ubuntu, CentOS, and Amazon Linux agents.
    Each agent executes independently but reports back to the same pipeline run.

---

## How it Works / Steps / Syntax

### ✅ Declarative Pipeline Example:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Parallel Execution') {
            parallel {
                stage('Ubuntu Build') {
                    agent { label 'ubuntu-node' }
                    steps {
                        echo "Building app on Ubuntu"
                        sh 'mvn clean install'
                    }
                }
                stage('CentOS Build') {
                    agent { label 'centos-node' }
                    steps {
                        echo "Building app on CentOS"
                        sh 'mvn clean install'
                    }
                }
                stage('Windows Build') {
                    agent { label 'windows-node' }
                    steps {
                        echo "Building app on Windows"
                        bat 'mvn clean install'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ⚙️ Key Points:

* `agent none` → disables the default agent at the pipeline level.
* Each **parallel stage** defines its **own agent**, so they can run on different machines.
* All parallel stages start simultaneously.
* Jenkins merges logs and shows separate results for each parallel branch.

## Common Issues / Errors

| Issue                              | Cause                                     | Example / Note                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ “No nodes labeled ‘ubuntu-node’” | Agent label mismatch                      | Ensure labels match the agent configuration in Jenkins.               |
| ❌ Workspace conflict               | Parallel stages writing to same directory | Use unique workspace paths for each agent (`customWorkspace`).        |
| ❌ Long queue wait                  | Limited number of executors               | Increase executors per node or add more nodes.                        |
| ❌ Build stuck or slow              | One stage hangs                           | Jenkins waits for *all* parallel stages to finish. Debug stuck agent. |
| ❌ Inconsistent results             | Shared resources between stages           | Use locks or isolated environments (Docker, temp dirs).               |

---

## Troubleshooting / Fixes

* **Label mismatch:** Check `Manage Jenkins → Nodes → Labels`. Update your Jenkinsfile or agent labels.
* **Executor bottleneck:** Add new nodes or increase executors under node configuration.
* **Workspace overlap:** Assign unique workspace paths:

  ```groovy
  agent {
      node {
          label 'ubuntu-node'
          customWorkspace "/var/jenkins/workspace/${env.BRANCH_NAME}-${env.STAGE_NAME}"
      }
  }
  ```
* **Hung parallel builds:** Check agent logs or use timeout:

  ```groovy
  options {
      timeout(time: 15, unit: 'MINUTES')
  }
  ```

---

## Best Practices / Tips

* ✅ Always label your agents clearly (e.g., `ubuntu-node`, `centos-node`).
* ✅ Avoid shared workspace between parallel agents.
* ✅ Add timeout for each parallel stage to avoid indefinite waits.
* ✅ Combine with `post` block for cleanup on failure.
* ✅ Keep stages independent — no inter-stage dependency inside the parallel block.
* ⚠️ Avoid parallelizing stages that share large files or global variables.
* ⚙️ For large pipelines, use `matrix` builds if environments/versions follow a predictable pattern (matrix scales better).

## 🧠 Real-World Scenario (Integrated Explanation)

In one real case, a team had a Spring Boot application that needed verification on **three OS types** before deployment.
Previously, they used three separate pipelines, each targeting a different agent — wasting time and effort.

By introducing **parallel execution**, they created a single Jenkins pipeline that:

* Triggered one build
* Distributed test jobs to Ubuntu, CentOS, and Windows agents
* Gathered results simultaneously

The total build time reduced from **30 minutes to 10 minutes**, and logs were consolidated in one view.
Matrix builds could have also solved this, but since the environments were limited and manually labeled, **parallel execution** was simpler and easier to manage.
