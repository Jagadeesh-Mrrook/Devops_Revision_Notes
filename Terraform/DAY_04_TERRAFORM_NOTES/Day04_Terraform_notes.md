## Terraform State Management Concepts Notes

### Detailed Explanation Version

#### 1. Terraform State (Local & Remote)

**Concept / What:**

* Terraform state is a **snapshot of your infrastructure**, mapping configuration files to real resources.

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Serves as the **source of truth** for Terraform.
* Tracks resource changes and prevents recreation.
* Needed for collaboration and auditing.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

* Local backend: stores `terraform.tfstate` in the working directory, with `terraform.tfstate.backup` automatically created.
* Remote backend (S3, GCS, Azure): state file stored remotely; versioning should be enabled for backups.
* Commands: `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Manual edits to state file ‚Üí corruption.
* Losing local state file ‚Üí inconsistent infra.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Restore from `.backup` (local) or enable S3 versioning (remote).

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Always use **remote backend** for collaboration.
* Avoid manual edits; use Terraform commands to modify infra.

---

#### 2. Backend Configuration (S3, GCS, Azure, Consul)

**Concept / What:**

* Backend defines **where Terraform state is stored** (local or remote).

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Enables **team collaboration**.
* Maintains a **central source of truth**.
* Supports **state locking and versioning**.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

* Run `terraform init` to configure backend.
* `provider` block is separate from backend.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Misconfigured bucket, region, or table ‚Üí backend init fails.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Verify S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, and permissions.
* Re-run `terraform init` if changes.

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Keep backend block in **root module**.
* Use separate files (e.g., `backend.tf`) for environment-specific configs.
* Enable encryption and versioning in remote backend.

---

#### 3. State Locking & Versioning

**Concept / What:**

* Prevents **simultaneous writes** to the state file by multiple users.
* Maintains **atomic operations**.

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Ensures **collaboration safety**.
* Prevents state file corruption when multiple engineers work concurrently.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

* Use **DynamoDB table** with S3 backend for locking:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

* Terraform locks the state during `apply` and releases after completion.
* `terraform force-unlock` can manually release lock (not recommended).

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Multiple users running `apply` simultaneously without lock ‚Üí state corruption.
* Incorrect DynamoDB setup ‚Üí locking fails.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Ensure DynamoDB table exists and supports atomic locking.
* Wait for lock to release; use `force-unlock` only if necessary.

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Always use **remote backend with locking** for team environments.
* Monitor locks in DynamoDB if issues arise.

---

## 4. Workspaces for Multi-Environment Setups

**Concept / What:**

* Workspaces allow **multiple independent states** using the same configuration.
* Each workspace corresponds to an environment (dev, staging, prod).

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Avoids duplicating configuration files.
* Isolates environments safely.
* Practical for **reusability and modularity**.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

```bash
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
terraform workspace show
```

* Local backend: state files per workspace with `.backup` automatically.
* Remote backend: workspace-specific keys; enable versioning for backup.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Wrong workspace selected ‚Üí apply affects wrong environment.
* Resource name conflicts across workspaces.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Always check workspace using `terraform workspace show`.
* Use unique names and S3 keys per workspace.

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Use clear workspace names (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
* Combine **remote backend + workspaces** for team safety.
* For critical production, consider separate configs instead of workspaces.

# Terraform Workspaces & Variables Notes

---

## üìò Detailed Explanation Version

### Concept / What
- **Terraform Workspace**: A way to manage multiple state files (e.g., dev, qa, prod) within the same Terraform configuration.
- **`terraform.workspace` variable**: Built-in variable that returns the name of the current workspace.
- **Workspace-based variables**: A method to assign different values (instance types, bucket names, etc.) depending on the active workspace.

---

### Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World
- **Purpose**: Run the same Terraform configuration across multiple environments without duplicating code.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Different EC2 sizes in `dev`, `qa`, `prod`.
  - S3 bucket names with environment suffixes.
  - VPC CIDR changes per environment.
- **Benefit**: One codebase ‚Üí multiple isolated environments.

# üåç Terraform Environment Management Notes

## üìò Detailed Explanation Version

### Concept / What

* **Environment Management** in Terraform = handling multiple environments (dev, qa, prod) from the same codebase.
* Two main approaches:

  1. **Separate Environment Directories** ‚Äì each env has its own `.tfvars`, state, backend, etc.
  2. **Workspaces + Variables** ‚Äì same config but behavior changes depending on active workspace.

---

### Why / Purpose / Use Case

* Avoid duplicating code for each environment.
* Enforce consistency between environments.
* Enable safe testing in `dev/qa` before applying in `prod`.
* Real-world orgs often mix both strategies depending on scale.

---

### Approach 1: Separate Environment Directories (most common in large teams)

**Folder structure:**

```
environments/
  dev/
    main.tf
    dev.tfvars
  qa/
    main.tf
    qa.tfvars
  prod/
    main.tf
    prod.tfvars
modules/
  vpc/
  ec2/
```

* Each env has:

  * Its own state file (usually remote backend with different key per env).
  * Its own `.tfvars` file with env-specific values.
* Example backend block (prod):

  ```hcl
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "tf-state-bucket"
    key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
  ```

---

### Approach 2: Workspaces + Variables (lightweight approach)

* **Workspaces** = multiple state files within same configuration.
* Built-in variable: `terraform.workspace`.

1. **Workspace commands**:

   ```bash
   terraform workspace new dev
   terraform workspace select prod
   terraform workspace show
   ```

2. **Use `terraform.workspace` in code**:

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
     bucket = "my-bucket-${terraform.workspace}"
   }
   ```

3. **Variable maps**:

   ```hcl
   variable "instance_type" {
     type = map(string)
     default = {
       dev  = "t3.micro"
       qa   = "t3.small"
       prod = "t3.medium"
     }
   }

   resource "aws_instance" "example" {
     instance_type = var.instance_type[terraform.workspace]
   }
   ```

4. **Workspace-specific tfvars**:

   * Files:

     ```
     dev.tfvars
     qa.tfvars
     prod.tfvars
     ```
   * Command:

     ```bash
     terraform apply -var-file=variables/${terraform.workspace}.tfvars
     ```

---

### Real-World Usage

* **Small orgs / POCs** ‚Üí Workspaces are quick & simple.
* **Large orgs / Enterprises** ‚Üí Separate environment directories with remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB, etc.).
* Often both are combined:

  * Directories for major envs (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
  * Workspaces inside dev (e.g., feature branches).

---

### Best Practices

* Always keep states isolated per environment.
* Name resources with env suffix/prefix (`myapp-dev`, `myapp-prod`).
* Document which approach is used in the project.
* Lock state remotely for team setups.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Revision Notes

* **Two main approaches:**

  1. **Separate Environment Directories**

     * Different folders for dev/qa/prod.
     * Each has own tfvars + backend.
     * Best for large orgs, strict isolation.

  2. **Workspaces + Variables**

     * Same config, multiple state files.
     * `terraform.workspace` used for names & maps.
     * Workspace-specific tfvars (`dev.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`).
     * Quick, less overhead.

* **Real-world use:**

  * Workspaces ‚Üí small setups.
  * Directories ‚Üí enterprise setups.
  * Sometimes both combined.

* **Best practice:** Always isolate states, suffix/prefix names with env, document setup.

---

### Common Issues / Errors
- **Forgetting to switch workspace** ‚Üí resources created in `default` workspace by mistake.
- **Map key missing**: If `terraform.workspace` value not defined in map, Terraform throws error.
- **Wrong tfvars file path**: Causes variable not found errors.

---

### Troubleshooting / Fixes
- Always run `terraform workspace show` before apply.
- Include a `default` key in maps as fallback.
- Validate tfvars file paths using `ls variables/` before applying.

---

### Best Practices / Tips
- Use workspaces mainly for **environments of same type** (dev/qa/prod) ‚Üí don‚Äôt mix entirely different projects.
- Keep variable values in version-controlled tfvars files.
- Use `terraform.workspace` with naming standards (e.g., `resource-${terraform.workspace}`).
- Automate workspace selection in CI/CD pipelines.


---

#### 5. Importing Existing Infrastructure

**Concept / What:**

* `terraform import` brings **existing cloud resources** under Terraform management.
* Does **not generate configuration files** automatically; only updates state.

**Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:**

* Migrates legacy or manually created infrastructure.
* Maintains **single source of truth**.
* Avoids recreating existing resources.
* **Terraformer** can automate generating `.tf` and state files for complex infra.

**How it Works / Steps / Syntax:**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-existing-bucket"
}
```

```bash
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.example my-existing-bucket
```

* Terraform updates **state file only**.
* With Terraformer:

```bash
terraformer import aws --resources=ec2 --regions=us-east-1 --profile=my-aws-profile
```

* Generates configuration and state files automatically.
* Run `terraform init` and `terraform plan` after import.

**Common Issues / Errors:**

* Resource mismatch ‚Üí Terraform may try to modify it.
* Wrong resource ID ‚Üí fails import.
* Backend misconfiguration ‚Üí state not updated.

**Troubleshooting / Fixes:**

* Verify resource IDs before import.
* Review generated `.tf` files (if using Terraformer).
* Run `terraform plan` to confirm no unexpected changes.

**Best Practices / Tips:**

* Import **one resource at a time** for control.
* Combine with **remote backend** for team collaboration.
* Document imported resources.

# Terraform Drift Management Notes

## Detailed Explanation Version

### Concept / What:

Terraform Drift occurs when changes are made manually to resources in the cloud, outside of Terraform. This makes the **state file** differ from the actual resources in the cloud.

### Why / Purpose / Use Case in Real-World:

* Ensures infrastructure remains consistent with code.
* Detects manual changes or accidental modifications made outside Terraform.
* Helps prevent overwriting unintended changes or accidental configuration drift.
* Useful in organizations where multiple engineers may have access to cloud resources.

### How it Works / Steps / Syntax:

1. **Detect Drift**

   ```bash
   terraform refresh
   ```

   * Updates the state file to match current cloud resources.
   * Configuration files remain unchanged.

2. **Review Changes**

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

   * Compares **configuration file** vs **state file**.
   * Shows what Terraform will change to reconcile configuration with cloud.
   * Example:

     ```
     ~ aws_instance.example
         instance_type: "t2.small" => "t2.micro"
     ```

     (State shows t2.small from cloud; configuration is t2.micro.)

3. **Resolve Drift**

   * **Accept manual changes:** Update configuration file to match the state.
   * **Ignore manual changes:** Keep configuration as-is; apply will overwrite cloud with configuration values.

4. **Optional - Import New Resources**

   ```bash
   terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
   ```

   * Adds manually created resources to Terraform state without modifying configuration.

### Common Issues / Errors:

* Applying without detecting drift may overwrite manual changes.
* Forgetting to refresh state may cause `plan` to show incorrect changes.
* Importing multiple resources at once can be risky; best to import one at a time.

### Troubleshooting / Fixes:

* Always run `terraform refresh` before `plan` if manual changes may exist.
* Use `ignore_changes` in the lifecycle block for attributes you want to remain unmanaged:

  ```hcl
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [tags, instance_type]
  }
  ```
* Ensure remote state and locking are used to prevent conflicts during collaborative work.

### Best Practices / Tips:

* Automate `refresh + plan` in CI/CD pipelines before apply.
* Use `ignore_changes` for attributes you want to remain untouched.
* Never apply blindly without reviewing drift.
* Keep configuration files updated when accepting cloud changes.
* Use versioned S3 backend to rollback state if needed.
